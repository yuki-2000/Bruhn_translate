# CHAPTER A2   EQUILIBRIUM OF FORCE SYSTEMS. TRUSS STRUCTURES

## A2.1 Introduction. 

The equations of static
equilibrium must constantly be used by the
stress analyst and structural designer in obtaining unknown forces and reactions or unknown
internal stresses. They are necessary whether
the structure or machine be simple or complex.
The ability to apply these equations is no
doubt best developed by solving many problems.
This chapter initiates the application of these
important physical laws to the force and stress
analysis of structures. It is assumed that a
student has completed the usual college course
in engineering mechanics called statics.
