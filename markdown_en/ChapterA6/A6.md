A6. 1 Introduction.
Problems involving torsion are common in
aircraft structures. The metal covered airplane
wing and fuselage are basically thin-walled
tubular structures and are subjected to large
torsional moments in certain flight and landing
conditions. The various mechanical control systems in an airplane often contain units of
various cross-sectional shapes which are subjected to torsional forces under operating conditions, hence a knowledge of torsional stresses
and distortions of members is necessary in aircraft structural design.


A6.2. Torsion of Members with Circular Cross Sections.

The following conditions are assumed in the
derivation of the equations for torsional
stresses and distortions: 

(1) The member is a circular, solid or hollow
round cylinder.


(2) Sections remain circular after application
of torque.


(3) Diameters remain straight after twisting of
section.


(4) Material is homogeneous, isotropic and
elastic.


(5) The applied loads lie in a plane or planes
perpendicular to the axis of the shaft or
cylinder. p

where J = polar moment of inertia of the shaft
cross section and equals twice the moment of inertia about a diameter.

From equa . t1 on (1) [GG] L [ _-] [ _~] r



sumed that any radial line undergoes angular
displacement only, or OB remains straight when
moving to OB' .
The unit shearing strain in a distance L
equals,

E=Aj3=r:,

Let G equal modulus of rigidity of the
material and let ~ equal the unit shearing
stress at the extreme fiber on the cross-section.



Hence, ~ = E G = r G G _

In Fig. A6.2 let ~P equal the unit shearing stress on a circular strip dA at a distance
p from O. Then

The moment of the shearing stress on the
circular strip dA about 0 the axis of the bar
is equal to,

dM = ~p pdA = ---L- and thus the total in

ternal torsional resisting moment is,


M = _J_ Gp"GdA

For equilibrium, the internal resisting
moment equals the external torsional moment T,
and since GG/L is a constant, we can write,



T = Mint. = G~ ]:P"dA = G~J

_A6.2_ TORSION



_A6.3_ Transmission of Power by a Cylindrical Shaft.
The work done by a twisting couple T in
moving through an angular displacement is equal
to the product of the magnitude of the couple
and the angular displacement in radians. If the
angular displacement is one revolution, the work
done equals 2 n T. If T is expressed in inchpounds and N is the angular velocity in revolutions per minute, then the horsepower transmitted by a rotating shaft may be written,



Problem 2.
Fig. A6.4 illustrates an aileron control
surface, consisting of a circular torque tube
(1-1/4 - .049 in Size) supported on three
hinge brackets and With the control rod fitting
attached to the torque tube above the center
support bracket. Find the maximum torsional
shearing stress in the tube if the air load on
the aileron is as indicated in Fig. A6.4, and
also compute the angle of tWist of tUbe between horn section and end of aileron.

Fig. A6.3 shows a conventional control
stick-torque tUbe operating unit. For a side
load of 150 Ibs. on stick grip, determine the
shearing stress on aileron torque tube and the
angle of twist between points A and B.


SOLUTION:


Torsional moment on tube AB due to side
stick force of 150i = 150 x 26 = 3900 in. lb.
The resistance to this torque is provided by the

150#



Fig. A6.4


SOLUTION:


The airload on the surface tends to rotate
the aileron around the torque tUbe, but movement is prevented or created by a control rod
attached to the torque tube over the center
supporting bracket.
The total load on a strip of aileron one
inch wide = 40(15 x 1/144) = 4.16 lb.
Let w equal intensity of loading per inch
of aileron span at the leading edge point of the
aileron surface, (see pressure diagram in
Fig. A6.4).
Then 3w + (0.5 w)12 = 4.16


hence w = 0.463 Ib./in.


The total load P 1 forward of the centerline of torque tube = 0.463 x 3 = 1.389 lb. and
P 2 the load on aileron portion aft of hinge line
= 0.463 x 0.5 x 12 = 2.778 lb.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-115-2.png)


The torsional moment per running inch of
torque tUbe: = - 1.389 x 1.5 + 2.778 x 4 = 9~0
in. lb. Hence, the maximum torque, which occurs
at the center of the aileron, equals 9.0 x 29 =
261 in. lb.

AG.4 Torsion of Members with Non-Circular Cross
Sections.

The formulas derived in Art. A6.2 cannot be
used for non-circular shapes since the assumptions made do not hold. In a circular shaft
sUbjected to pure torsion, the shearing stress
distribution is as indicated in Fig. A6.5,
namely, the maximum shearing stress is located
at the most remote fiber from the centerline
axis of the bar and is perpendicular to the
radius to the stressed point. At a given distance from the axis of rotation the shear stress

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-116-0.png)

'L max.

is constant in both directions as illustrated in
Fig. A6.5, which means that ends of segments of
the bar as it twists remain parallel to each
other or in other words the bar sections do not
warp out of their plane when the bar twists.
If the conditions of Fig. A6.5 are applied
to the rectangular bar of Fig. A6.6, the most
stressed fibers will be at the corners and the
stress will be directed as shown. The stress
would then have a component normal to the surface as well as along the surface and this is
not true. The theory of elasticity shows that
the maximum shear stress occurs at the centerline of the long sides as illustrated in Fig.
A6.6 and that the stress at the corners is zero.
Thus when a rectangular bar tWists, the shear
stresses are not constant at the same distances
from the axis of rotation and thus the ends of
segments cut through the bar would not remain
parallel to each other when the bar tWists or in
other words, warping of the section out of its
plane takes place. Fig. A6.7 illustrates this
action in a twisted rectangular bar. The ends
of the bar are warped or suffer distortion
normal to the original unstressed plane of the
bar ends.
Further discussion and a summary of equations for determining the shear stresses and



AG.3


twists of non-circular cross-sections is given
in Art. A6.6.


AG. 5 Elastic Membrane Analogy.
The shape of a warped cross-section of a
non-circular cross-section in torsion is
needed in the analysis by the theory of elasticity, and as a result only a few shapes such
as rectangles, elipses, triangles, etc., have
been solved by the theoretical approach. However, a close approximation can be made experimentally for almost any shape of crosssection by the use of the membrane analogy.
It was pointed out by Prandtl that the
equation of torsion of a bar and the equation
for the deflection of a membrane subjected to
uniform pressure have the same form. Thus if
an elastic membrane is stretched over an opening which has the same shape as the crosssection of the bar being considered and then if
the membrane is deflected by subjecting it to a
slight difference of pressure on the two sides,
the resulting deflected shape of the membrane
provides certain quantities which can be measured experimentally and then used in the
theoretical equations. However, possibly the
main advantage of the membrane theory is, that
it provides a method of visualizing to a
considerable degree of accuracy how the stress
conditions vary over a complicated cross-section
of a bar in torsion.
The membrane analogy provides the following relationships between the deflected membrane and the twisted bar.


(1) Lines of equal deflection on the membrane
(contour lines) correspond to shearing
stress lines of the twisted bar.


(2) The tangent to a contour line at any point
on the membrane surface gives the direction
of the resultant shear stress at the corresponding point on the cross-section of the
bar being tWisted.


(3) The maximum slope of the deflected membrane
at any point, with respect to the edge
support plane is equal in magnitude to the
shear stress at the corresponding point on
the cross-section of the tWisted bar.

(4) The applied torsion on the tWisted bar is
proportional to twice the volume included
between the deflected membrane and a plane
through the supporting edges.


To illustrate, consider a bar With a
rectangular cross-section as indicated in Fig.
A6.8. Over an openin~ of the same shape we
stretch a thin membrane and deflect it normal
to the cross-section by a small uniform pressure. Equal deflection contour lines for this
deflected membrane will take the shape as illustrated in Fig. A6.9. These contour lines
which correspond to direction of shearing
stress in the tWisted bar are nearly circular
near the center region of the bar, but tend


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-117-full.png)

A6.4 TORSION



to take the shape of the bar boundary as the
boundary is approached. Fig. A6.9a shows a section through the contour lines or the deflected
membrane along the lines 1-1, 2-2 and 3-3 of Fig.
A6.9. It is obvious that the slopes of the deflected surface along line 1-1 will be greater
than along lines 2-2 or 3-3. From this we can
conclude that the shear stress at any point on
line 1-1 will be greater than the shear stress
for corresponding points on lines 2-2 and 3-3.

Although equations (8) and (9) have been
derived for a narrow rectangular shape, they
can be applied to an approximate analysis of
shapes made up of thin rectangular members
such as illustrated in Fig. A6.10. The more
generous the fillet or corner radius, the
smaller the stress concentration at these junctions and therefore the more accuracy of these
approximate formulas. Thus for a section made
up of a continuous plate such as illustrated in

From Table A6.1 it is noticed that for
large values of bit, the values of t he constants is _1/3,_ and thus for such narrow rectangles, equations (6) and (7) reduce to,

stress will occur at the ends of line 1-1. The
slope of the deflected membrane will be zero at
the center of the membrane and at the four
corners, and thus the shear stress at these
points will be zero.


A6.6 Torsion of Open Sections Composed of Thin Plates.
Members having cross-sections made up of
narrow or thin rectangular elements are sometimes used in aircraft structures to carry torsional loads such as the angle, channel, and Tee
Shapes.
For a bar of rectangular cross-section of
width b and thickness t a mathematical elasticity
analysis gives the following equations for maximum shearing stress and the angle of tWist per
unit length.

changes but the shear force q does not change, The elastic strain energy dU stored in this
or element therefore equals,



The product ~ is generally referred to as
the shear flow and is given the symbol q. The
name shear flow possibly came from the fact that
the equation ~t = constant, resembles the equation of continuity of fluid flow qS = constant
where q is the flow velocity and S the tube

cross-sectiona~ area.
We will now take moments of the shear flow
q on the tube cross-section about some point (0).
In Fig. A6.13 the force dF on the wall element
dF = qds. Its arm from the assumed moment center (0) is h. Thus the moment of dF about (0)
is qdsh. However, ds times h is twice the area
of the shaded triangle in Fig. A6.13.
Hence the torsional moment dT of the force
on the element ds equals,


dT         - qhds .. 2qdA


and thus for the total torque for the entire
shear flow around the tUbe wall equals,


T = fA 2qdA and since q is constant



T = q2A


or

where A is the enclosed area of the mean periphery of the tube wall.

Choose any moment axis such as point (0).

For equilibrium, the torsional moment of
the internal shear system must equal the external torque on the tube at this particular
section. Thus, from the conclusions of article
A6.9, we can write:

.
T = 2q1A~ **+** **2q2A2** **+** **2q3A3** **-** **- -** - - (24)



(22) For elastic continuity, the twist of each cell
must be equal, or Q~ = Q2 = Q3'

But from equation (21), q3 = q~   - q2' From equation (19), the angular tWist of a cell
SUbstituting the value of q3 in (22) is

Q = ~ _i_ ds or
2AG _j_ t



                                (23)


where A~ = area of cell (1) and A2 = area of
cell (2). Therefore, the moment of the internal
shear system of a multiple cell tUbe carrying
pure torsional shear stresses is equal to the
sum of twice the enclosed area of each cell
times the shear load per inch which exists in
the outside wall of that cell. (Note: The web
mn is referred to as an inside wall of either
cell)

Fig. A6.17 shows in general the internal
shear flow pattern on a 3-cell tube produced by
a pure torque load on the tube. The cells are
numbered (1), (2) and (3), and the area outside
the tube is designated as cell (0). Thus, to
designate the outside wall of cell (1), we refer to it as lying between cells 1-0; for the
outside wall of cell 2, as 2-0; and for the web
between cells (1) and (2) as 1-2, etc.

q~ = shear load per inch = ~~t~ in the outside wall of cell (1), where ~~ equals the unit
stress and t~ = wall thickness. Likewise,
q2 = ~2t2 and q3 = ~3t3 = shear load per inch in
outside walls of cells (2) and (3) respectively.
For equilibrium of shear forces at the junction
points of interior webs with the outside walls,
we have (q~ - q2) equal to the shear load per

With one unknown shear flow q for each cell,
the solution by the previous equations becomes

The method of successive approximations

Consider a two cell

Since practically all cellular aircraft

Therefore assuming aG1. = 1 for cell (1) of

the tWist measured by the term GQ will be computed for each cell.

(1-2) is sUbjected to a shear flow q,. =- .109#
_lin._ (counterclockwise with respect to cell (1)
and therefore negative), in addition to the
shear flow q~ = .212 of cell (1). The negative
shear flow q,. =- .109 on web 1-2 decreases the
twist of cell (1) as calculated above With the
resulting value for GQ 1 = 0.875 instead of 1.0
as started With.
Thus in order to make GQ 1 = 1 again, we
will have to add a constant shear flow q~ to
cell (1) which will cancel the negative twist
due to q" acting on web (1-2). Since we are
considering only cell (1) we can compare cell
wall strains instead of cell tWist since in
equation (41), the term 2A is constant.
Thus adding a constant shear flow qi to
cancel influences of q,. on web 1-2, we can write:


qi _(z_ ~) cell (1) - q" (~) web 1-2 = 0

Thus to make GQ~ equal to 1 we must correct
the shear flow in cell (1) by adding a constant
shear flow equal to .237 times the shear flow q"

in cell (2) which equals .237 x .109 = .0258~/in.
Since this shear flow is in terms of the shear
flow q" of the adjacent cell it will be referred
to as a correction carryover shear flow, and
will consist of a carryover correction factor
times q".

Thus the carryover factor from cell (2) to
cell (1) may be written as

Since Q 1 must equal 9" if the cross-section
is not to distort from its original shape, it is
evident that the above shear flows are not the
true ones when the two cells act together as a
unit.
Now consider cell (1) in Fig. d. In bringing up and attaching cell (2) the common web

Now consider cell (2) in Fig. d. In
bringing up and attaching cell (1), the common
web (2-1) is subjected to a shear flow of q~ =
- 0.212*/in. (counterc~ockwise as viewed from
cell 2 and therefore negative). This additional
shear flow changes GQ" tWist of cell (2) to a
relative value of 0.4375 instead of 1.0 (see
previous GQ" calculations). Therefore to make
GQ,. equal to 1.0 again, a corrective constant
shear flow q~ must be added to cell (2) to

hence

Substituting in equation (43):

Thus the carryover factor from cell (1) to

Explanation of Table 1


Line 1 gives the carryover factors for
each cell, computed as explained before. Line 2
gives the necessary constant shear flow q in
each cell to give unit rate of twist to each
cell acting independently. (GQ = 1). Line 3
gives the first set of constant corrective shear
flows to add to each cell. The corrective q referred to as the carryover q or C.O.q in the
table consists of the q in the adjacent cell
times the C.O. factor of that cell.
Thus .237 x .109 = .0258 is carryover from
cell (2) to cell (1) and .277 x .212 = .0587 is
carryover from cell (1) to cell (2).
Line 4 gives the second set of corrective
carryover shear flows, namely .277 x .0258 =
.00717 to cell (2) and .237 x .0587 - .0139 to
cell (1). Line 5 repeats the corrective carry
over process once more. Line 6 gives the final
q values which equal the original q plus all
carryover q values.

Line 2 gives the shear flow q in each cell,
when it is assumed each cell is acting separately and is sUbjected to a unit rate of twist
or GQ '" 1.
The calculations for the q values are as
follows: 

For cell (1)

For cell (2)


2 x 100 "'.4

A1 and As equal cell area of cells (1) and (2)
respectively. L = length of wall element and t
its corresponding thickness.

In order not to start out with decimal values
of q, the values above will arbitrarily be
multiplied by 100 to make q1 = 25#/in. and

qs = 40~/in. Since we want only relative
values of terms this is permissible. These
values are shown in line 2 of Table (2). The
corrective carryover process proper is started
in line 3 of table (2). In cell (1) the amount
carried over of q1 = 25 to cell (2) equals the
C.O. factor times 25 or 0.4 x 25 = 10 which is
written along the vertical line under cell (2).
Likewise in cell (2) the amount of qs - 40 that
is carried over to cell (1) equals the C.O.
factor times qs or .25 x 40 = 10, which is
written along the vertical line lmder cell (1).
The second set of corrective carryover
constant shear flows are given in line 4 of
Table (2), thus, .4 of the q1 = 10 = 4.0 is
carried over to cell (2) and .25 x value of
q1 = 10 = 2.5 is carried over to cell (1). Line
5 repeats the process namely 0.4 x 2.5 = 1 to
cell (2) and .25 x 4 = 1.0 to cell (1).
This process of carrying over values of q
is continued until the values are small or
negligible. Line 8 gives the final q values in
each cell as the summation of the assumed q
value plus all carryover values of q. Thus in
cell (1) q 38.85#/in. and for cell (2)
q = 55.5. Line 9 gives the torque that these
values of cell shear flow can produce.

qs = 18870 x 55.5 = 58.9#/in.


These values are shown in line 11 of Table
2. Check on tWist of cells under final q values.
The relative total strain around each cell

boundary is given by the term A ~ q t for the

cell.
Thus for cell (1)

Thus both cells have the same tWist.

In the above calculations q1 and qs act
clockwise in each cell, hence the shear flow on
the interior common web is the difference of the
two q values.

The balance of the solution or procedure in
Table 3 is the same as explained for Problem 1
in Table (2). It should be noticed that cell
(2) being between two cells receives carryover
q values from both adjacent cells and these two
values are added together before being distributed or carried over again to a djacent cells.
For example consider line 3 in Table (3) and
cell (2). The q value 5.82 representing .23 x
25.3 is brought over from cell (l) and the q
value 3.08 = .288 x 10.70 from cell (3). These
two values are added together or 5.82 + 3.08 =
8.90. The carryover q to cell (1) is then .21
x 8.90 = 1.87 and to cell (3) is .284 x 8.90 =
2.53.
In line 8, the final q in cell (2) equals
the original q of 18.45 plUS all carryover q
values from each adjacent cell.
Line 10 in Table (3) shows the total torque
developed by the reSUltant internal shear flow
is 17435"#. Since the problem was to find the
shear flow system for a torque of - 100,000 in.
lb., the values of q in line 8 must be mUltiplied by the factor 100,000/17435.
Line 11 shows the final q values.

In Fig. A6.27 the values in the rectangles
represent the cell areas. The values in ( )
represent the L/t values for the particular wall
or web. After studying example problems 1 and 2
one shOUld have no trouble checking the values



For the open type stiffener as illustrated in
Fig. A6.28, the torsional rigidity of the individual stiffeners as compared t 0 the torsional
rigidity of the thin-walled cell is so small
to be negligible. However a closed type
stiffener is essentially a small sized tUbe and
its stiffness is much greater than an open
section of similar size. Thus a cell With
closed type stiffeners attached to its outer
walls could be handled as a mUltiple cell structure, with each stiffener acting as a cell with
a common wall with the outside surrounding cell.
Since in general the stiffness provided by the
stiffeners is comparatively small compared to
the over-all cell, the approximate simplified
procedure as given in NACA T.N. 542 by Kuhn can
be used to usually give sufficient accuracy. In
this approximate method, the thin-walled tube
and closed stiffeners are converted or transformed into a single thin-walled tube by modifying the closed stiffeners by either one of the
following procedures: 

(1) Replace each closed stiffener by a doubler
plate having an effective thickness
te=tSTs/d, and calculate ¢ dS/t with these
doubler plates in place. The enclosed area
of the torsion tube still remains (A) or
the same. See Fig. A6.30.

(2) Replace the skin over each stiffener by a
"liner" in the stiffener having a thickness
t e = tSK dis. (See Fig. A6.31.) The enclosed area _(A)_ of the cell now equals the
original area less that area cross-latched
in Fig. A6.3l.


Procedure (1) slightly overestimates and
procedure (2) slightly underestimates the stiffness effect of the stiffeners.
The corner members of a stiffened cell are
usually open or solid sections and thus their
torsional resistance can be simply added to the
torsional stiffness of the thin-walled over-all
cell.

A6.17 Effect of End Restraint on Members Carrying

Torsion.

The equations derived in the previous part
of this chapter assumed that cross-sections
throughout the length of the torsion members
were free to warp out of their plane and thus
there could be no stresses normal to the crosssections. In actual practical structures restraint against this free warping of sections
is however often present. For example, the
airplane cantilever wing from its attachment to
a rather rigid fuselage structure is restrained
against warping at the wing-fuselage attachment
point. Another example of restraint is a heavy
wing bulkhead such as those carrying a landing
gear or power plant reaction. The flanges of
these heavy bulkheads often possess considerable
lateral bending stiffness, hence they tend to
prevent warping of the wing cross-section.
Since only torsional forces are being considered
here as being applied to the member, the stresses produced normal to the cross-section of the
member namely, tension and compression must add
up zero for equilibrium. Thus the applied torque is carried by pure torsion action of the
member and part by the longitudional stresses
normal to the member cross-sections. The percentage of the total torque carried by each
action depends on the dimensions and shape of
the cross-section and the length of the member.
Fig. _A6.32_ illustrates the distortion of an
open section, namely, a channel section sUbjected to a pure torsional force T at its free end
and fixed at the other or supporting end. Near
the fixed end the applied torque is practically
all resisted by the lateral bending of the top
and bottom legs of the channel acting as short
cantilever beams, thus forming the couple with H
forces as illustrated in the Figure. Near the
free end of the member, these top and bottom
legs are now very long cantilever beams and thus
their bending rigidity is small and thus the
pure torsional rigidity of the section in this
region is greater than the bending rigidity of
the channel legs.

Fig. A6. 33 Fig. A6. 34 Fig. A6. 35

Fig. _A6.34_ shows the torque dividing into two
parts, namely the couple force F-F formed by
bending of the flanges of the I-beam and the
pure shearing stress system on the crosssection. Fig. _A6.35_ shows the tWisting of the
section through a distance 0.


The solution will consist in computing the
angle of tWist Q under the two stress conditions and equating them.
Let TB be the proportion of the total
torque T carried by the flanges in bending
forming the couple F-F in Fig. _A6.34._ From
Fig. _A6.35,_ the angle of twist can be written

A6.18 Example Problem lllustrating Effect of End
Restraint on a Member in Torsion.

Fig. _A6.33_ shows an I-beam subjected to a
torsional moment T at its free end. The problem will be to determine what proportion of the
torque T is taken by the flanges in bending and
what proportion by pure shear, at two different
sections, namely 10 inches and 40 inches from
the fixed end of the I-beam.

Note: The deflection of a cantilever beam with
a load F at its end equals FL [3] /3EI, and I the
moment of inertia of a rectangle about its center axis = tb [3] /12.


hence


Now let Tt be the portion of the total torque
carried by the member in pure torsion. The approximate solution for open sections composed of
rectangular elements as given in Art. _A6.6,_
equation (12) will be used.


fi = 3 Tt L
t Gt [3] (b + b w)


Equating fiB to fit, we can write


TB = 3 E h 2 b [3]

2 2
Tt 8L Gt (2b + bw)


SUbstituting values when L = 10 inches.


TB = 3 x 10.5 X 10 6 x 3.4 x 1.75 =

Tt 8 X 10 [2] x 3.7 X 10 [6] x 0.1 [2] (2 x 1.75 + 3.3)


= 9.65


Therefore, percent of total torsional T
taken by bending of flanges equals,


TB TB
TB + Tt (100) = TB + TB (100) = 90.5 percent.

9.65


If we consider the section 40 inches from
the fixed end, then L = 40 inches. Thus if 40 [2]
is placed in the above substitution instead of
10 [2] the results for TB/Tt would be 0.602 and
the percent of the torque carried by the flanges
in bending would be 36 as compared to 90.5 percent at L = 10 inches from support. Thus in
general the effect of the end restraint decreases
rapidly with increasing value of L.
The effect of end restraint on thin walled
tubes With longitudional stiffeners is a more

The shaft rotates at constant speed. The difference in belt pullan two sides of a pulley
are shown on the figure. Calculate the maximum
torsional shearing stress in the 1-3/4 inch
shaft between pUlleys (1) and (2) and between
(2) and (3).


(2) A 1/2 HP. motor operating at 1000 RPM
rotates a 3/4-.035 aluminum alloy torque tube
30 inches long which drives the gear mechanism
for operating a wing flap. Determine the maximum torsional stress in the torque shaft under
full power and RPM. Find the angular deflection
of shaft in the 30 inch length. Polar moment of
inertia of tube = .01 in. Modulus of rigidity
