A9.l Introduction



In observing the inside of an airplane
fuselage or seaplane hull one sees a large number of structural rings or closed frames. Some
appear quite light and are essentially used to
maintain the shape of the body metal shell and
to provide stabilizing supports for the longitUdinal shell stringers. At points where large
load concentrations are transferred between body
and tail, wing power plant, landin~ gear, etc.,
relatively heavy frames will be observed. In
hull construction, the bottom structural framing transfers the water pressure in landin~ to
the bottom portion of the hull frames which in
turn transfers the load to the hull shell.


In general the frames are of such shane
and the load distribution of such character
that these frames or rings undergo bending
forces in transferring the applied loads to the
other resisting portions of the airplane body.
These bending forces produce frame stresses in
general which are of major importance in the
strength proportioning of the frame, and thus
a reasonable close approximation of such bending forces is necessary.


Such frames are statically indeterminate
relative to internal resisting stress and thus
consideration must be given to section and
physical properties to obtain a solution of the
distribution of the internal resisting forces.


General Methods of Analysis:


There are many methods of applying the
principles of continuity to obtain the solution
for the redundant forces in closed rings or
frames and bents. The author prefers the one
which is Generally referred to as the "Ji:IClStic
Center" method and has used it for many years in
routine airplane design. The method was ori~i­
nated by MUller-Breslau~. The main difference
in this method as compared to most other methods
of solution is that the redundant forces are assumed actinG at a special point called the elastic center of the frame Which Gives resulting
eq,mtions for the redundants which are ind'pendent of each other.


(j)Muller-Breslau, H., Die Neueren Hethden der
Festigkeitslehre und der Statik der Baukonstruktionen. Leipzig, 1886.



In the derivations which follow the distortions due to axial and shear forces are neglected. In general these distortions are small
compared to frame bending distortions and thus
the error is small.


In computing distortions plane sections are
assumed to remain plane after bending. This is
not strictly true ])ocause the curvature of the
frame charl";es this linear distribution of bending stresses on a frame cross-section. (Corrections for curvature influence are given in
Chapter 1\13.


Furthermore it is assumed that stress is
proportional to strain. Since the airplane
stress analyst must calculate the ultimate
strenGth of a frame, this assumotion obviously
does not hold with heavy frames where the rupturing stresses for the frame are above the proportional limit of the frame material.



This chapter will deal only with the
oretical analysis for bending moments in
and rings by the elastic center method.
tical questions of body frame design are
in a later chapter.

A9.2 BENDING MOMENTS IN FRAMES AND RINGS


Consider a small element ds of the curved
beam as shown in Fig. A9.2. Let Ms equal the
bending moment on this small element due to the
given external load system. The total bending
moment on the element ds thus equals,


(Moments which cause tension on the inside
fibers of the frame are regarded as posit i ve moments. )


The following deflection equations for
point (A) must equal zero:

A9.2 Derivation of Equations. Unsymmetrical Frame.


Fig. A9.1 shows an unsymmetrical curved
beam fixed at ends (A) and (B) and carrying
some external loading P~, P e, etc. This
structure is statically indeterminate to the
third degree because the reactions at (A) and
(B) have three unknown elements, namely, magnitUde, direction and line of action, making a
total of six unknowns with only three equations
of static equilibrium available.



Q = 0 (angular rotation of (A) = zero)

~x = 0 (movement of (A) in x direction = 0)

~y = 0: (movement of (A) in y direction = 0)



Q = Z MInds _

In equation (2) the term m is the bending
moment on a element ds due to a unit moment
applied at point (A) (See Fig. A9.3). The bending moment is thus
equal one or unity

of frame. ~it moment

Then SUbstituting in equation (2) and using value of M from
equation (1) we obtain

Fig. A9.2 whence,



In Fig. A9.2 the reaction at (A) has been
replaced by its 3 components, namely, the forces
XA and YA and the moment MA and the structure
is now treated as a cantilever beam fixed at
end (B) and carrying the redundant loads at _(A)_
and the known external loading P~, P e, etc.
Because joint _(A)_ is actually fixed it does not
suffer translation or rotation when structure
is loaded, thus the movement of end _(A)_ under
the loading system of Fig. _A9.2_ must be zero.
Therefore, three equations of fact can be
written stating that the horizontal, vertical
and angular deflection of point _(A)_ must equal

zero.



Q = ZMsdS EI + MAZ~ EI _ XAZ [YdS] EI + YA EI ZXdS -- 0 (5)


In equation (3) the term m represents the
bending moment on a element ds due to a unit
load applied at point (A) and acting in the x
direction, as illustrated in Fig. A9.4.


The applied unit y
load has a positive ; ds

However the bending moment on the ds element
shown is negative (tension in top fibers), thus
the value of m =- (1) Y = -Yo The minus sign
is necessary to give the correct bending moment
sign.

In equation (4) the term m represents the
bending moment on a element ds due to a unit

illustrated in Fig. A9.5. Hence, m = l(x) = x

equation (4) and Y ds

Equations 5, 6, 7 can now be used to solve
for the redundant forces MA, XA and YA' With
these values known the true bending moment at
any point on structure follows from equation
(1) 

REFERRING REDUNDANTS TO ELASTIC CENTER


For the purpose of simplifying equations
5, 6, 7, let it be assumed that end A is
attached to a inelastic arm terminating at a
point (0) as illustrated in Fig. A9.6. The
point (0) coincides with the centroid of the
ds/EI values for the structure. Reference
axes x and y will now be taken with point (0)
as the origin. The redundant reactions will
now be placed at point (0) the end of the

place of XA, YA and MA respectively.


The axes x and y through the point (0) are
centroidal axes for the values ds/EI of the
structure. This fact means that the summations

and


The expressions Z x [2] ds/EI, Z y2 ds /EI and
Z xyds/EI also appear in equations 6 and 7.
These terms will be referred to as elastic
moments of inertia and product of inertia of
the frame about y and x axes through the elastic
center of the frame, and for simplicity will be
given the following symbols.


Equations 5, 6 and 7 will now be rewritten
using the redundant forces at point (0).

hence,


                     -                     -                     -                     -                     -                     -                     -                     -                     -                     -                     (8)

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-218-1.png)


The term MoZ yds/EI is zero since Z ydS/EI
is zero, thus Mo drops out When substituting in
Equat i on (6).

The term Msds/EI represents the angle
change between the end faces of the ds element
When acted upon by a constant static moment Ms'
This angle change which actually is equal in
value to the area of the Ms/EI diagram on the
element ds will be given the symbol Os' that is,
0 s = Msds/EI. With this symbol SUbstitution,
equations 8, 9, 10 can now be rewritten as
follows:

Since point A suffers no movement in the actual
structure, then we can say that point (0) must
undergo no movement since (0) is connected to
point (A) by a rigid arm.

redundant forces Xo and Yo we obtain,

The tenns ix and i y are the elastic moment

Due to symmetry of the structure about the

between the sides of the frame, and thus the
elastic center (0) lies on this axis.

calculations to determine the location of the
elastic center and the elastic moments of
inertia. The reference axes used are x~-x~

Thus to solve these three equations we
must assume a static frame condition consistent
with the given frame and loading. In general
there are a number of static conditions that can
be chosen. For example in this problem we
might select one of the statically determinate
conditions illustrated in Fig. A9.8 cases 1 to
5.

To illustrate the use of different static
conditions, three solutions will be presented
with each using a different static condition.


Solution No.1


In this solution we will use Case 3 as the
static frame condition. The bending moment on
the frame for this static frame condition is
given in Fig. A9.9. The equations

for the redundants require ¢s the area of the
Ms/I diagram. Fig. A9.10 shows the Ms/I curve
which is obtained by dividing the values in
Fig. A9.9 by the term 2 which is the moment of
inertia of member BC as given in the problem.
Since the equations for Xo and Yo require the
moment of the Ms/I diagram as a load about
axes through the elastic center of frame, the
area of the Ms/I diagram will be concentrated
at the centroid of the diagram and along the
centerline of the frame, or more accurately



A9.5


along the neutral axis of the frame members.


In Fig. A9.10 the area of the Ms/I diagram
equals 0 s = 22.5 x _24/2_ = 270. The centroid by
simple calculations of this triangle would fall
10 inches from B. Fig. A9.11 now shows the
frame with its Ms/I or its 0s load. 0s is

Adding this bending moment diagram to the static _ -~0sx _ -[-45(-10)-405x6-300(-12)-90OX12]

The final bending moments could also be
obtained by substituting directly in equation
(1) using subscript (0) instead of (A). Thus,


M = Ms + Mo - Xoy + Yox  - - - - - - -(19)


For example, determine bending moment at
point B.


For point B, x = -12 and y = 9.375, Ms = 0
substituting in (19)


MB = 0 + (-8.437)   - .7939 x 9.375 +
.1562 (-12) = -17.75 as previously
found


AT rOINT D. x = 12, Y = -20.625, Ms = O.


MD = 0 + (-8.437)   - .7939 (-20.625) +
.1562 x 12 = 9.81 in.lb.

In this solution we will use Case 4 (See
Fig. A9.8) as the assumed static condition,
that is two cantilever beams with half the
external load or 5 lb. acting on each cantilever. Fig. A9.14 shows the static bending

Subt. in (19)


MB = -30+51.56-.7939x9.375+2.656(-12)

MD = -90+51.56 7939(-20.625) + 2.656 x 12
**=** **9.80** in. lb.


Solution No.3


In this solution we will use Case 5
(Fig. A9.8) as the assumed static condition,
namely a frame with 3 hinges at points A, D and
E, as illustrated in Fig. A9.16.



To find VA take ~Fy = 0 = -10 + 2.5 + VA

= 0 hence VA = 7.5.


To find HD take moments about hinge at E of
all forces on frame to right side of E and
equate to zero.


mE = -2.5 x 12 + 30HD = 0, hence HD = 1.


Then using ~Fx = 0 for entire frame, we obtain

~Fx = -1 + HA = 0, hence HA = 1.

In order to take moments of the ¢s values
in column (4) of the table, the centroid of
each portion of the diagram must be determined.
For example, the centroid of the two triangular
bending moment portions marked 1 and 6 is
.667 x 30 from the lower end or 20 inches as
shown in Fig. A9.17. Thus the distances x
and y from this 0 s location to the y and x



MB = -30+12.19-(-0.203)9.375+0.1562(-12)
      - -17.76 in.lb.(checks previous solutions)


Consider point D:

x = 12, y = -20.625, Ms = 0


Subt. in (19)


MD = 0+12.19-(-0.203) (-20.625)+0.1562x12
= 9.82 in. lb. (checks previous solutions)


The final complete bending moment diagram
would of course be the same as drawn in Fig.
A9.13 for the results of Solution No. I.


Example Problem 2.


Fig. A9.18 shows a rectangular closed
frame supported at points A and B and carrying
the external loads as shown. The reaction at D
due to rollers is vertical. The frame at point
A is continuous through the joint but the
reaction is applied through a pin at the center
of the joint. The problem is to determine the
bending moment diagram.



w = lO#/in.

.Solution:


The first step is to find the location of
the elastic center of the frame. Due to
symmetry of frame about the y axis, the elastic
center will be on a y axis through the middle
of the frame. The vertical distance y
measured from a axis through AD equals,


_Z(¥)_ y __ 3~X24+234x12X2

The next step is to determine the elastic
moment of inertia of the frame about x and y
axes through the elastic center of the frame.


Moment of inertia about x axis = Ix :

Members AB and DC,



The next step is to choose a static frame
condition and determine the static (M s ) bending
moment diagram. In this solution the frame is
assumed cut on member AB just above point A as
illustrated in Figs. A9.18, 19 and 20. For
simplicity the static moment curve has been
drawn in three parts, with each part considering only one of the three external given loads
on the structure. Figs. A9.18, 19, 20 show
these resulting bending moment curves. The
portions of these bending moment diaGrams

nl~bered 1 to 10 are shown in the parenthesis
on each portion.


The next step in the solution consists of
finding the area of the Ms/I diagrams and the
first moment of these diagrams about the x and
y axes through the elastic center. These simple
calculations can b est be done in table form as

illustrated in Table A9.3.

Fig. A9.26



Solution. Due to symmetry of the ring
structure the elastic center falls at the
center of the ring. Since the ring has been
assumed with constant cross-section, a relative
value of one will be used for I.



A9.9


Total elastic weight of ring =


z ~ = n (36) = 113.1
I 1


The elastic moment of inertia about x and y
axes through center point of ring are the same
for each axis and equal


Ix = Iy = nr 3 = n x 18 3 = 18300


The next step in the solution is to assume
a static ring condition and determine the static

(M s ) diagram. In general it is good practice
to try and assume a static condition such that
the Ms diagram is symmetrical about one or if
possible about both x and y axes through the
elastic center, thus making one or both of the
redundants Xo and Yo zero and thus reducing
considerably the amount of numerical calculation for the solution of the problem.


In order to obtain symmetry of the Ms
diagram and also the Ms/I diagram since I is
constant, the static condition as shown in
Fig. A9.24 is assumed, namely, a pin at (e) and
rollers at (f). The static bending moment at
points (a), (b), (c) and (d) are the same
magnitude ann equal,


Ms = 50(18   - 18 cos 45 [0 ] ) = 265 in. lb.


The sign is positive because the bending moment
produces tension on the inside of the ring.


The next step is to determine the 0s ' 0sx
and 0 s Y values.


0s is the area of the Mg/I diagram, however since I is unity it is the area of the M s
diagram. The static Ms diagram of Fig. A9.24
is divided into similar portions labeled (1)
and (2). Hence


0s(~) = area of portion (1) = Pr [2] (a -sin _a),_
where P = 50 lb. and a = 45 [0 ]   

Substituting and multiplying by 4 since there
are four portions labeled (1).,


0s(~) = 4[50 x 18 [2] (0.785   - 0.707)J = 5052


The area of portion labeled (2) equals,


Pr [2] e(1 - cos _a)._


Since there are two areas (2) we Obtain,


0 S (2)= 2[50 X 18 [2] x ~ (1-0.707)J = 15000


Hence, total 0 8 = 15000 + 5052 = 20052


Since the centroid of the Ms diagram due
to symmetry about both x and y axes coincides


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-225-full.png)

A9.10 BENDING MOMENTS IN FRAMES AND RINGS



with the center or el~stic center of the frame,
the terms z0 sx and Z0 s Y will be zero.


Substituting to determine the value of the
redundants at the elastic center we obtain,


M o = ~~:'I ::  - ~~~~~2) ::  - 177 in. lb.


X o = z0 Ix s Y = 20052(0)18300 = 0


Yo = -Z0sx = -(20052)(0) :: 0
Iy 18300


Fig. A9.25 shows the values acting at the
elastic center and the bending moment diagram
produced by these forces. Adding the bending
moment diagram of Fig. A9.25 which is a constant
value over entire frame of -177 to the static
moment diagram of Fig. A9.24 gives the final
bending moment diagram as shown in Fig. A9.26.


Example Problem 4. Hull Frame


Fig. A9.27 shows a closed frame subjected
to the loads as shown. The problem is to
determine the bending moment di~gram.



Solution:


The first step is to determine the elastic
center of the frame and the elastic moments of
inertia. Table A9.4 shows the calcUlations. A
reference axis x'-x' has been selected at the
midpoint of the side AB. Since a static frame
condition has been selected to make the M s
diagram symmetrical about y axes through the
elastic center (see Fig. A9.28), it is not
necessary to determine Iy since the redundant
Yo will be zero due to this s~~etry.


Table A9.4

|Totals|||221. 2||1468|262140|



In the last column of Table A9.4 the term
ix is the moment of inertia of a particular
member about its o\Vll centroidal x axis. Thus

     - 262140 - 6.64 [2] (221.2) = 252400


The next step in the solution is to compute the static moment elastic weights 0 8 and
their centroid locations. In Fig. A9.28, the
static frame condition assumed is a pin at point
A and rollers at point A', which gives the

the redundants can be solved for:


(1007000 + 172800 + 1.56800) =
221.2


12430"#


X o = Z0 I xx [s] Y =

_1007000 x 48.16 + 172800 x 33.36 + 156800 x -5.24
    - 252400


= -98.5#


Yo is zero because of the symmetrical frame
and loading. The final or true bending moment
at any point equals


Thus for point B


MB = 0 + (-12430) - (-98.5 x 23.36) =


-10130"#


For point C


Ms at point C = 4690 x 38.4   - _20OX(38.4)2/2_

= 32700


Hence Me = 32700 - 12430 - (-98.5 x -60.64) =
14300"#

frame bending moment diagram.

A9.12 BENDING MOMENTS **IN** FRAMES AND RINGS



half of a symmetrical hull frame that was used
in an actual seaplane. The main external load
on such frames is the water pressure on the hull
bottom plating. The hull bottom stringers
transfer the bottom pressure as concentrations
on the frame bottom as shown. The resistance to
this bottom upward load on the frame is provided
by the hull metal covering which exerts tangential loads on the frame contour. The question
as to the distribution of these resisting
forces is discussed in later chapters. In this
problem the resisting shear flow in the hull
sheet has been assumed constant between the
chine point and the upper heavy longeron. For
analysis purposes the frame has been divided
into 20 strips. The centroid of these strips
located on the neutral axis of the frame sections are numbered 1 to 20 in Fig. A9.21. The
tangential skin resisting forces are shown as
concentrations on frame strips # 6 to # 16. On
the figure these tangential loads have been
replaced by their horizontal and vertical components. The sum of the vertical components
should equal the vertical component of the
bottom water pressure.


Table A9.5 shows the complete calculations
for determining the bending moment on the frame.
Columns 1 to 7 give the calculations for the
elastic properties of the frame, namely the
elastic weight of the frame; the elastic center
location, and the elastic centroidal moment of
inertia about the horizontal ~entroidal elastic
axis. A reference horizontal axis X'X' has
been selected as shown. All distance recorded
in the table have been obtained by scaling from
a large drawing of the frame.


The static condition assumed for computing
the Ms moments is a double symmetrical cantilever beam as illustrated in Fig. A9.32. The
frame is cut at the top to form the free end
of the cantilever beams, and the fixed end
has been taken at the centerline bottom frame
section. The static bending moment diagram
will be symmetrical about the y axis through
the elastic center of the frame and thus the
redundant Yo at the elastic center will be
zero since the term Z0 sx will be zero. The
calculations for determining the static
moments Ms in Column 8 of Table A9.5 are not
shown. The student should refer to Art. A5.9
of Chapter A5 to refresh his thinking relative
to bending moment calculations on curved beams.


Columns 9 and 10 give the calculations of
the 0 s values (area of MsfI diagram) and the
first moment (0 sx values). The summations of
columns 3, 9, 10 permits the solution for the
redundants Mo and Xo as shown below the table.
The final bending moment M at any point on the
frame is by simple statics equals,



The moment of inertia of the frame
cross sections are given in column
2 of Table A9. 6 which have been

determined from a consideration

of the actual dimensions of the

A9.14 BENDING MOMENTS IN FRAMES AND RINGS



The distance x from the line AB to the
elastic center is,


x = (15)0 + 6 x 6 + 10 x 1231 = 5.032 in.


The distance y from line Be to elastic
center equals,


15 x 7.5 + 6 x 0 + 10 x 5
y = 31   - 5.842 in.


The elastic moments of inertia Ix and Iy
and the product of inertia I xy are required.



Fig. A9.36 shows the centroid locations of
the 0 8 values along the center line of the
frame. The moment of these 0s values about the
x and y axes will now be calculated.


Z0sx = (-2160)(-3.032) + (-21600)(-5.032) +
(-4860)(-5.032) = 139700


Z0 sY = (-2160)(5.242) + (-21600)(-2.258) +
(-4860)(-6.758) = 70290


The values of the redundants at the elastic
center can now be calculated using equa~ions
(11), (14), (15), namely



Ix = (11'2 [5] )" + (15)(2.258)2 + (12 2)(5.242)2 + (10)"12 11 =~ 0 Zds/I =- (-28620) 31 = 923 in. lb.



+ (10)(0.242)2 = 606.51


Iy = (1.5) (5.032)2 + (12)" 2x12 +(12) 2 (0 968)2 +•


(10) (6.968)2 = 942.96


Ixy = (15) (-5.032) (-2.858) + (1:) (0.968) (5.242)


+ (10)(6.968)(0.242) = 217.74


The next step is to assume some static
frame condition and draw the static bending
moment diagram. Fig. A9.35 shows that the
frame has been assumed cut near point C which
gives two cantilever beams. The bending
moment diagram in three parts for this static
condition is also shown on Fig. A9.35.

A9.6 Analysis of Frame with Pinned Supports.


Fig. _A9.42_ shows a rectangular frame and
loading. This frame is identical to example
problem 1 of Art. _A9.3,_ except it is pinned at
points A and D instead of fixed.


The first step will be to determine the
elastic weight of the frame, the elastic center
location and the elastic moments of inertia
about axes through the elastic center.


The term ds/EI of a beam element of length
ds represents the angle change between its two
end faces when the element is acted upon by a
unit moment. In this chapter this term has
been called the elastic weight of the element.
Physically, the elastic weight is the ability
of the element to cause rotation when acted
upon by a unit moment. When a unit moment is
applied to a rigid support, the support suffers
no rotation since the support is rigid, therefore a rigid support has zero elastic weight
and therefore does not figure in the frame
elastic properties.

If a support is pinned or hinged it has
no resistance to rotation and thus a unit
moment acting on a hinge would have infinite
angle change or rotation and therefore a hinge
or pin possesses infinite elastic weight.

Due to symmetry of structure about the
centerline y axis the elastic center will lie
on this axis. Since the two hinges at A and
B have infinite elastic weight, the centroid
or elastic center of the frame will obviously
lie midway between A and B. Fig. A9.43 shows
the elastic center 0 connected to the point A
by a rigid bracket.


~ds/EI for frame is infinite because of
the hinges at A and B.


The elastic moment of inertia about a y
axis through elastic center is infinite since
the hinge supports have infinite elastic weight.


Ix is calculated as follows:    

For Portion AB = ~ x ~ X 30 3 = 3000

11=
For Portion CD ="3 x 3" x 30 [3] 3000


For Portion BC = 24 x ~ X 30 [2] :: 10800


Ix = 16800


Fig. A9.44 shows the static frame condition assumed to obtain the M s values.


The value of 0s for member BC equals the
area of the M s curve divided by I for BC,
hence 0s = 45 x 24 x 1 = 270. The centroid
2"" 2"
of this 0s value is 10 inches from point B.
The redundant forces at the elastic center can
now be solved for

The support D
has zero elastic
weight and the pin

therefore the elastic

The total elastic

infinite because of
pin at A.



The elastic moments of inertia will be
calculated about x and y axes through A.


Ix = [16800] [ (Same] [ as] [ previous] [ example)]

Ixy = (33 [0 ] x 15 x 24) + (2: x 30 x 12) = 7920


The static frame condition will be assumed
the same as in the previous example problem,
hence 0s = 270 and acts 10" from B (Fig. A9.48).

A9.8 Solution of Unsymmetrical Frames Using Principal
Axes.


For the frame of A9.51 the axes X and y
through the elastic center are not principal
axes because the elastic product of inertia

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-233-1.png)


Fig. A9.51 Fig. A9.52

Ixy is not zero. However, for the principal
axes xp and yp as shown, the product of inertia
is zero. Thus if the redundant forces at the
elastic center are referred to the principal
axes as illustrated in Fig. A9.52, then the
same form of equations for the redundants
result as for symmetrical structure, namely



Y = - Z¢sxp -(21)
op Iyp


Where Ixp and Iy are the elastic moments of
inertia about th~ principal axes and yp and xp
the perpendicular distance from the ¢s loads
to the principal axes.


The author prefers to use the longer
equations (14) and (15) which avoid finding the
principal axes location, the properties about
these axes and the perpendicular distances
with respect to these axes, thus decreasing the
numerical work required.


The student Should use equations (19),
(20) and (21) to solve example problem 1 of
Art. A9.5 in order to compare the two methods
of solution.

CHAPTER AlO

**STATICALLY INDETERMINATE STRUCTURES**

**SPECIAL** **METHOD - THE COLUMN ANALOGY METHOD**



A10.l General. The Column Analogy* method is a
method that is widely used by engineers in determining the bending moments in a bent or
ring type structure. The method considers
only distortions due to bending of the
structure.


The numerical work in using the column
analogy method is practically identical to
that carried out in applying the elastic center
method of Chapter A9.


A10. 2 General Explanation of Column Analogy Method.

Fig. A10.l shows a short column loaded in
compression by a load P located at distances
(a) and (b) from the principal axes x and y of
the column cross-section.


Fig. A10.l

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-234-1.png)


_1I1I_ _)/ltl/"/llf,'I,_


To find the bearing stress between the
supporting base and the lower end of the
column, it is convenient to transfer the load
P to the column centroid plus moments about
the principal axes. Then if we let _a_ equal the
bearing stress intensity at some point a
distance x and y from the yy and xx axes, we
can write


_a_   - - _ P +   - --T- (Pa)y +   - --- (Pb)x
A ~x I
y


Where A is the area of the column crosssection and Pa and Pb the moment of the load
P about the xx and yy axes respectively. If
we let Pa = Mx and Pb = My, the above equation
can be written,



Now assume we have a frame whose centerline
length and shape is identical to that of the
column section in Fig. A10.l. The width of each
portion of this frame will be proportional to
llEI of the member. Fig. A10.2 shows this
assumed frame. Furthermore, assume that end B
of the frame is fixed and that a rigid bracket
is attached to the end A and terminating at
point (0) the elastic center of the frame. The
frame is subjected to an external loading,
w", w .., etc.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-234-0.png)


Fig. A10.2


This cantilever structure will suffer bending distortion under the external load system
w", w .., etc., and point (0) will be displaced.
Point (0) can be brought back to its original
undeflected position by applying a couple and
two forces at (0), namely, Mo, Xo and Yo as
shown in Fig. A10.2. Since point (0) is attached
to frame end A by the rigid bracket these three
forces at the elastic center (0) will cause
point A to remain stationary or in other words
to be fixed. Therefore, for the frame in Fig.
A10.2 fixed at A and B, the moment and two forces
acting at the elastic center cause the statically indeterminate moments Mi when resisting a
given external loading causing static moments
Ms. The final true bending moment M at a point
on the frame than equals


From Fig. A10.2 we can write for a point
on the frame such as B that the indeterminate
bending moment Mi equals,

A10.2 THE COLUMN ANALOGY METHOD



      - ~       - Z0sx X       - Z0 sY
Mo - zds/I ' YO =, 0   - IX
Iy


The term Z0 s represents the area of the
static Ms/I curve. (E has been assumed constant and therefore omitted). Let the term
z0s be called the elastic load and give it a
new symbol P. The term Zds/I equals the
elastic weight of the frame and equals the sum
of the length of each member times its width
which equals _III._ Let this total frame elastic
weight be given a new symbol A.


In the expressions for Yo and Xo the
terms Z0 sx and Z0 sY represent the moment of
the static Mil curve acting as a load about
the y and x axes respectively passing through
the frame elastic center. Therefore let z0 sx
be given a new symbol My and Z0 sY a new
symbol Mx ' With these new symbols, equation
(2) can now be rewritten as follows: 


(4) The final or true bending moment M at any
point then equals,


                    -                     -                     -                     -                     -                     -                     -                     -                     -                     -                     (5)


Example Problem 1.


Fig. AIO.3 shows a rectangular frame with
fixed supports at points A and. D. The bending
moments at points A, B, C and D will be determined by the column analogy method. This
frame and loading is identical to example
problem 1 of Art. A9.4 of Chapter A9 where the
solution was made by the elastic center method.

Comparing equations (1) and (3) we see
they are similar. In other words, the indeterminate bending moments Mi in a frame are
analogous to the column bearing pressures cr,
hence the name "Column Analogy" for the method
using equation (1). With this general explanation, the method can now be clearly explained by giving several example problem
solutions.


A10.3 Frames with One Axis of Symmetry.


From the previous discussion we can write,


(1) The cross-section of the analogous column
consists of an area, the shape of which
is the same as that of the given frame
and the thickness of any part equals
l/EI of that part.


(2) The loading applied to the top of the
analogous column is equal to the Ms/EI
diagram, Where Ms is the statical moment
in any basic determinate structure derived from the given frame. If Mg
causes bending compression on the inside
face of the frame it is a positive bending
moment and the analogous load P on the
column acts downward.


(3) The indeterminate bending moment Mi at a
given frame point equals the base
pressure at this same point on the
analogous column. Thus the indeterminate
moment at any point on the frame equals
(from eq. 3),

SOLUTION NO. 1



2.5



We first consider the frame centerline
shape as shown in Fig. AIO.3 as the crosssection of a short column (see Fig. AIO.5). The
Width of each portion of the column section is
equal to l/EI of the member cross-section.
Since E is constant, it will be made unity and
the widths will then equal _III._

The first step in the calculations is to
compute the area (A) of the column cross-section
in Fig. AIO.5 and the moments of inertia of the
column cross-section about x and y centroidal

axes.


Area A = Z T ds = "3 30 + 3"" 30 + 2 24_   - 32

and I would be identical to the complete
calculations given in Art. A9.4, and Table A9.1
where this same problem is solved by the elastic
center method. These calculations will not be
repeated here. The results were, Ix = 3188
and Iy = 3456.


Since the frame is statically indeterminate the next step is to assume a static frame
condition consistent with the given frame and
loading. Fig. AIO.4 shows the condition
assumed for this solution, namely, pinned at
point A and a pin with rollers at point D.
The static Ms diagram is therefore as shown in
Fig. AIO.4. we now load the column crosssection with the Ms/I diagram as a load as
shown in Fig. AIO.5. The static moment sign
is positive because the static condition causes
tension on the inside face of the frame. In
the column analogy method a positive Ms/I
loading is a downward or compressive load on
top of column, and therefore a negative Ms/I
value would be an upward or tension load on
the column.


Equation (3) requires the values of the
Mx and My the moment of the Ms/I diagram as a
load about the x and y axes. Equation (3)
also requires the total column load P which
equals the area of the Ms/I diagram.


For this problem the value of P from
Fig. AIO.5 equals,



A10.3


Mx = 270x9.375 = 2530 (positive because
base pressure is compressive on column portion
above x axis).


My = - (270 x 2) =- 540 (negative because
base pressure is tension on column portion to
right of yaxis).

The centroid of this triangular loading
is 2 inches to left of y axis. Fig. AIO.6
shows the column sectioll with this resultant

load P.


We now use equation (3) to find the indeterminate moments Mi which are equal to the
base pressures on the column. Equation (3)
involves bending moments Mx and My and
distances x and y, all of which must have
signs. The signs will be determined as follows:


When moment Mx produces compression on
base on that portion above x axis, then Mx is
positive.


When moment My produces compression on
base on that portion to right of y axis, then
My is positive.


A distance y measured upward from x axis
is posit-ive; measured downward is negative.


A distance x measured to right from y
axis is positive, to left negative.

A10.4 THE COLUMN ANALOGY METHOD



Solution No.2


In this solution a different static frame
condition will be assumed as shown in Fig.
AIO.8, namely the frame is cut under the load
and one-half the 10 lb. load will be assumed
as going to each cantilever part. Fig. AIO.9
shows the static moment diagram and Fig.

locations of each portion of diagram which

which checks solution 1.

are numbered (1), (2), (3) and (4). The area
of each of these portions will represent a
load P 1, P s, etc. on the column in Fig. AIO.ll.
Since the static moment is negative on each
portion the load on the column section will be
upward.


P 1 =-10(30) =-300, P" =-45x9 =-405


P s =- 15(6) /2 =- 45, P 4 = - 30 x 30 = - 900


P = L:P =- 300 - 45 - 405 - 900 =- 1650


From Fig. AIO.ll


Mx =- (45 -\- 405) 9.375 + (300 + 900) 5.635

= 2531



Mi = -1650 + 2531(-20.625) + (-9180)12
32 3188 3456


= -99.82


MD = Ms -Mi = - 90 - (-99.82) = 9.82 in.lb.


Thus solution 2 checks solution 1. The
stUdent should solve this problem using other
static conditions.


A10.4 Unsymmetrical Frames or Rings.

In applying the column analogy method to
unsymmetrical frames and rings, the moment of
the M/EI diagram must be taken about principal
axes and the moments of inertia with respect to
principal axes.


However, as explained for the elastic center method in Chapter A9, the moments and
section properties with regard to centroidal
axes can be used if Mx, My, Ix and I are modified to take care of the dis-Symmetr~ of the
structure. In Art. A9.2 it was shown that the
redundant forces at the elastic center to unsymmetrical frame sections was, (see equations
11, 14, 15 of Art. A9.2).



M -~-p(
My = 300 x 12 + 45 x 10 - 405 x 6 - 900 x 12 o - L:dsjEI - T same as for symmetrical
frame)

AlO.5



As previously done in Art. AIO.2 let, SOLUTION:



Furthermore, let,


My = My _(2r3-)_ and M~ = Mx (~)
y x


and k = (1 -~)
x y


Then sUbstituting in equations (a) and (b)
we obtain,


From equation (2) we have,


Substituting values of Xo and Yo into this
equation, we obtain as the equation for Mi the
indeterminate moment in the column analogy
method, the following 

Mi =~+ (Mx-My)y + (My-Mx)X (6)
A klx kl
y


The true moment is the same as for the
symmetrical section, namely,


Thus the solution of an unsymmetrical
frame by the column analogy method follows the
same procedure as for a symmetrical section
except that equation (6) is used instead of
equation (3).


AlO. 5 Example Problem - Unsymmetrical Section.


Fig. AIO.12 shows a loaded unsymmetrical
frame fixed at points A and D. Required, the
true bending moments at points A, B, C and D.
This problem is identical to example problem
1 of Art. A9.5 where a solution was given by
the elastic center method.

Fig. AIO.13 shows the cross-section of the
analogous column. The length of each member of
the column section being the same as in Fig.
AIO.12, and the ",'i0th of each portion being l/I.
The first step in the solution is to find the
column section properties.


The total area (A) of column section equals
(15/1) + (10/1) + (12/2) = 31.


The other properties required are:   - Ix'
Iy and Ixy•


The calculations to determine the location
of the centroidal x and y axes and the above
properties about these axes would be identical
to that given in example problem 1 of Art. A9.5
of Chapter A9, where this same problem was
solved by elastic center method. The results
were Ix = 606.51, Iy = 942.96 and Ixy = 217.74.
The location of the axes were as shown in Fig.
AIO.13.


The next step in the solution is to choose
a static frame condition and determine the
static (M s ) diagram. Fig. AIO.14 shows the
assumed static condition, namely, two cantilevers
because of the frame cut as shown. The figure
also shows the static bending moment diagram
made up of three portions labeled (1), (2) and
(3). The area of each portion of the moment
diagram divided by the (I) for that frame portion will give the loads P on the column.

AlO.6 THE COLUMN ANALOGY METHOD



These loads act on the centerline of the
frame members and through the centroid of the
geometrical moment diagram shapes. These
centroid locations are indicated by the heavy
dots in Fig. AIO.14 and their locations are
given with respect to the centroidal x and y
axes. The loads P~, P 2 and P 3 are now placed
on the column in AIO.13, acting upward because
they are negative.


We now find the moments Mx and M which
equal the moments of the loads P about the
centroidal axes.


Mx = - 2160 x 5.242 + 21600 x 2.258 + 4860
x 6.758 = 70290


My = 2160 x 3.032 + 21600 x 5.032 + 4860
x 5.032 = 139700


To solve equation (6) we must have the
terms ~, M; and k.


M' = M (~) = 70290 x 217.74/606.51
'j{ x Ix


= 25234


My = M y (~) I = 139700 x 217.74/942.96
y

= 32258


k = (1 _ Ixy 2 ) = 217.74 [2]
IxI (1 - 606.51 x 942.96)
y

= .9171


SUbstituting values in equation (6) we obtain,


-28620 + (70290 - 32258 )y +
31 0.9171 x 606.51


(139700 - 25234)x
0.9171 x 942.96


whence,


Mi =-923+68.37Y+132.36x    - - - - - (7)



Frame Point **C.** x = 6.968, Y = 5.242


Mi = - 923 + 68.37 x 5.242 + 132.36 x 6.968

= 357.7


Me = Ms - Mi = 0 - (357.7) =- 357.7 in .lb.


Frame Point D. x = 6.968, Y =-4.758


Mi =-923+68.37 (-4.758) + 132.36 x6.968


= -326


MD = Ms -Mi = 0 - (-326) = 326 in.lb.


The above results check the solution of
this same problem by the elastic center method
in Art. A9.5 of Chapter A9. The student should
solve this problem by choosing other static
frame conditions.
