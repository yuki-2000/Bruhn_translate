# CHAPTER A4 GENERAL LOADS ON AIRCRAFT



## A4.1 Introduction.
Before the structural design of an airplane
can be made, the external loads acting on the
airplane in flight, landing and take-off conditions must be known. The complete determination of the air loads on an airplane requires a
thorough theoretical knowledge of aerodynamics,
since modern aircraft fly in sub-sonic, transsonic and super-sonic speed ranges. Furthermore, there is a wide range of wing configurations, such as the straight tapered wing, the
swept wing and the delta wing, and many of
these wings often include leading and trailing
edge devices for promoting better lift or control characteristics. The presence of power
plant nacelle units, external fuel tanks, etc.
are units that affect the airflow around the
wing and thus affect the magnitude and distribution of the air forces on the wing. Likewise,
the fuselage or airplane body itself influences
the airflow over the wing. The theoretical calculation of the airloads on the airplane is too
large a subject to be covered in a structures
book and it is customary in college aeronautical
curricula to provide a separate course for this
SUbject.
In most airplane companies the loads on
the airplane are determined by a group of engineers assigned to the structures Analysis
Section and this group is often referred to as
the Aircraft Load Calculation group. While the
work of this group is primarily based on the
use of aerodynamics, it is that phase of aerodynamics which is concerned with determining
the magnitude and distribution of the air loads
on the airplane so that the airplane structure
can be properly designed to support these air
forces safely and efficiently. The engineering
department of an airplane company has a distinct
or separate aerodynamics section, but in general
their responsibility is the use of the SUbject
of aerodynamics to insure or guarantee the performance, stability and control of the airplane.
A basic general over-all knowledge of the
loads on aircraft is desirable in the study of
aircraft structural theory, and hence this
chapter attempts to give this information. In
a later chapter dealing with wing design, this
subject will be further expanded.


## A4.2 Limit or Applied Loads. Design Loads.
Because an airplane is designed to carry
out a definite job, there result many types of
aircraft relative to size, configuration and
performance. For example, a commercial transport like the Douglas DC-8 is designed to do a
job of transporting a certain number of pass


engers safely, efficiently and comfortably over
various distances between airports. On the
other hand the Air Force Fighter type of aircraft has a job of shooting down enemy aircraft
or protecting slower friendly aircraft. To do
this job efficiently requires a far different
configuration as compared to the DC-8 transport.
Furthermore the Fighter type airplane must be
maneuvered far more sharply to do its required
job as compared to the DC-8 in doing its required job.
In general the magnitUde of the air forces
on an airplane depend on the velocity of the
airplane and the rate at which this velocity is
changed in magnitude and direction (acceleration).
The magnitude of the flight acceleration factor
may be governed by the capacity of the human
body to withstand these acceleration inertia
forces without injury which is the situation in
a fighter type of airplane. On the other hand
the maneuvering accelerations for the DC-8 are
not dictated by what the human body can Withstand, but are determined by what is necessary
to safely transport passengers from one airport
to another.
Designing the airplane structure for loads
greater than the airplane suffers in the performance of its reqUired job, obviously will add
considerable weight to the airplane and decrease
its performance or over-all efficiency relative
to the job it is designed to do.
To particularly insure safety in the airtransportation, along With uniformity and ef
ficienc~ of design, the government aeronautical
agencies (civil and military) have definite requirements for the various types of aircraft
relative to the magnitude of loads to be used in
the structural design of aircraft. In referring
in general to these specified aircraft loads two
terms are used as follows:
Limit or Applied Loads.
The terms limit and applied refer to the
same loads With the civil agencies (C.A.A.)
using the term limit and the military agencies
using the term applied.
Limit loads are the maximum loads anticipated on the airplane during its lifetime of
service.
The airplane structure shall be capable of
supporting the limit loads Without suffering
detrimental permanent deformations. At all loads
up to the limit loads the deformation of the
structure shall be such as not to interfere With
the safe operation of the airplane.

Ultimate or Design Loads.
These two terms are used in general to mean



A4.1


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-71-full.png)

A4.2 GENERAL LOADS ON AIRCRAFT



the same thing. Ultimate or Design Loads are
equal to the limit loads multiplied by a factor
of safety (F.S.) or


Design Loads = Limit or Applied Loads times F.S.

In general the over-all factor of safety is
1.5. The government requirements also specify
that these design loads be carried by the
structure without failure.
Although aircraft are not supposed to
undergo greater loads than the specified limit
loads, a certain amount of reserve strength
against complete structural failure of a unit is
necessary in the design of practi8ally any machine or structure. This is due to many factors
such as:- (1) The approximations involved in
aerodynamic theory and also structural stress
analysis theory; (2) Variation in physical
properties of materials; (3) Variation in fabrication and inspection standards. Possibly
the most important reason for the factors of
safety for airplanes is due to the fact that
practically every airplane is limited to the
maximum velocity it can be flown and the maximum acceleration it can be subjected to in
flight or landing. Since these are under the
control of the pilot it is possible in emergency conditions that the limit loads may be
slightly exceeded but with a reserve factor of
safety against failure this exceeding of the
limit load should not prove serious from an
airplane safety standpoint, although it might
cause permanent structural deformations that
might require repair or replacements of small
units or portions of the structure.
Loads due to airplane gusts, are arbitrary
in that the gust velocity is assumed. Although thiS gust velocity is based on years of
experience in measuring and recording gust
forces in flight allover the world, it is qUite
possible that during the lifetime of an airplane, turbulent conditions near storm areas or
over mountains or water areas might produce air
gust velocities slightly greater than that
specified in the load requirements, thus the
factor of safety insures safety against failure
if this situation would arise.


The broad general category of external
loads on conventional aircraft can be broken
down into such classifications as follows:

Due to Airplane Maneuvers. (under
the control of the pilot).
(1) Air Loads Due to Air Gusts. (not under

(control of pilot).



Thrust.
(3) Power Plant Loads Torque.



(6) Weight and Inertia Loads.


In resolving external loads for stress
analysis purposes, it is convenient to have a
set of reference axes. The reference axes
XYZ passing through the center of gravity of the
airplane as illustrated in Fig. A4.0 are those
normally used in stress analysis work as well as
for aerodynamic calCUlations. For convenience
the reference axes are often referred to another
origin other than the airplane c.g.

A4.4 Weight and Inertia Forces.
The term weight is that constant force, proportional to its mass, which tends to draw every
physical body toward the center of the earth.
An airplane in steady flight (uniform velocity)
is acted upon by a system of forces in equilibrium, namely, the weight of the airplane, the air
forces on the complete airplane, and the power
plant forces. The pilot can change this balanced steady flight condition by changing the
engine power or by operating the surface controls
to change the direction of the airplane velocity.
These unbalanced forces thus cause the airplane
to accelerate or de-accelerate.

Inertia Forces For Motion of Pure Translation
of Rigid Bodies.

If the unbalanced forces acting on a rigid
body cause only a change in the magnitude of the
velocity of the body, but not its direction, the
motion is called translation, and from basic
Physics, the accelerating force F = Ma, where M

is the mass of the body or Wig. In Fig. A4.1
the unbalanced force system F causes the rigid
body to accelerate to the right. Fig. A4.2 shows
the effect of this unbalanced force in producing

a force on each mass particle of m~a, msa, etc.,
thus the total effective force is Zilla = Ma. If
these effective forces are reversed they are referred to as inertia forces. The external
forces and the inertia forces therefore form a
force system in equilibrium.
From basic Physics, we have the following
relationships for a motion of pure translation
if the acceleration is constant:


_A4.3_


at = ra, and an = rw [s] an acceleration normal to

the flight path at A and directed toward the
center of rotation (0). From Newton's Law the
effective forces due to these accelerations

are:
Mrw [s ] = Mvs;r   -   - (4)
Fn =


Mra   - - -   -   - -   - -   -   - (5 )
Ft =


Where w = angular velocity at the point A.
a = angular acceleration at point A.
r = radius of curvature of flight path
at point A.


The inertia forces are equal and opposite
to these effective forces as indicated in Fig.
A4.3. These inertia forces can then be considered as part of the total force system on the
airplane which is in equilibrium.
If the velocity of the airplane along the
path is constant, then at = zero and thus the
inertia force Ft = 0, leaving only the normal
inertia force Fn 
If the angular acceleration is constant,
the following relationships hold.

v = final velocity after time t.


Inertia Forces on Rotating Rigid Bodies.

A common airplane maneuver is a motion
along a curved path in a plane parallel to the
XZ plane of the airplane, and generally referred
to as the pitching plane. A pUll up from steady
flight or a pUllout from a dive causes an airplane to follow a curved path. Fig. A4.3 shows
an airplane following a curved path. If at
point A the velocity is increasing along its
path, the airplane is being sUbjected to two
accelerations, namely, at, tangential to the
curve at point A and equal in magnitude to



where G = angle of rotation in time t.

W o = initial angular velocity in rad/sec.:
w = angular velocity after time t.


In Fig. A4.3 the moment To of the inertia
forces about the center of rotation (0) equals
Mra(r)= Mrsa. The term Mr 2 is the mass moment
of inertia of the airplane about point (0).
Since an airplane has considerable pitching
moment of inertia about its own center of gravity
axis, it should be included. Thus by the
parallel axis


To = loa + I a - - - - - - - - - - - - - (9)
e.g
where 1 0 = Mrs and I e.g = moment of inertia of
airplane about Y axis through e.g. of airplane.


Inertia Forces For Pitching Rotation of Airplane
about Y Axis Through e.g. airplane.


In flight, an air gust may strike the horizontal tail producing a tail force which has a
moment about the airplane e.g. In some landing
conditions the ground or water forces do not
pass through the airplane e.g., thus producing
a moment about the airplane e.g. These moments
cause the airplane to rotate about the Y axis
through the e.g.
Therefore for this effect alone the center
of rotation in Fig. A4.3 is not at (0) but at

the pure rotation is I a, (a couple) and
e.g.
thus the moment of this inertia couple about the
e.g. = T = I a.
e.g. e.g.
As explained before if the inertia forces
are included with all other applied forces on
the airplane, then the airplane is in static
equilibrium and the problem is handled by the
static equations for equilibrium.


## A4.5 Air Forces on Wing.

The wing of an airplane carries the major
portion of the air forces. In level steady
flight the vertical upward force of the air on
the wing, practically equals the weight of the
airplane. The term airfoil is used when referring to the shape of the cross-section of a
wing. Figs. A4.4 and A4.5 illustrate the air
pressure intensity diagram due to an air


air forces on the wing. For example, consider
the two air pressure intensity diagrams in Figs.
A4.6 and A4.7. These distributed force systems
can be replaced by their reSUltant (R), whiCh
of course must be known in magnitUde, direction
and location. The location is specified by a
term called the center of pressure which is the
point where the resultant R intersects the airfoil chord line. As the angle of attack is
changed the reSUltant air force changes in magnitUde, direction and center of pressure
location.

Lift and Drag Components of ReSUltant Air Force.

Instead of dealing with the reSUltant force
R, it is convenient for both aerodynamic and
stress analysis considerations to replace the
resultant by its two components perpendicular
and parallel to the airstream. Fig. A4.8 illustrates this resolution into lift and drag
components.

stream flowing around an airfoil shape for both
a positive and negative angle of attack. The
shape and intensity of this diagram is influenced by many factors, such as the shape of
the airfoil itself, as the thiokness to chord
ratio, the camber of the top and bottom surfaces etc. A normal wing is attached to a
fuselage and it may support external power
plants, wing tip tanks etc. Furthermore the
normal wing is usually tapered in planform
and thickness and may possess leading and
trailing slots and flaps to produce high lift
or control effects. The airflow around the
wing is affected by such factors as listed
above and thus wind tunnel tests are usually
necessary to obtain a true picture of the air
forces on a wing relative to their chordwise
spanwise distribution.

Aerodynamic Center (a.c.). Since an airplane flies at many different angles of attack,
it means that the center of pressure changes for
the many flight design conditions. It so happens, that there is one point on the airfoil
that the moment due to the Lift and Drag forces
is constant for any angle of attack. This
point is called the aerodynamic center (a.c.)
and its approximate location is at the 25 percent
of chord measured from the leading edge. Thus
the resultant R can be replaced by a lift and
drag force at the aerodynamic center plus a wing
moment Ma.c. as illustrated in Fig. A4.9.


## A4.6 Forces on Airplane in Flight.

forces on the airplane in an accelerated flight
condition.

Therefore the loads on the airplane can be discussed in terms of load factors. The applied or
limit load factors are the maximum load factors
that might occur during the service of the particular airplane. These loads as discussed in
Art. A4.2 must be taken by the airplane structure without appreciable permanent deformation.
The design load factors are equal to the
limit load factors multiplied by the factor of
safety, and these design loads must be carried
by the structure without rupture or collapse, or
in other words, complete failure.



a definite maximum flight velocity. For commercial airplanes the velocity is limited to a
reasonable glide speed which is sufficient to
take care of reasonable flight operations.


## A4.9 Gust Load Factors.
When a sharp edge gust strikes the airplane
in a direction normal to the thrust line (X
axis), a sudden change takes place in the wing
angle of attack with no sudden change in airplane
speed. The normal force coefficient (C Z ) can

be assumed to vary linearly With the angle of

## A4.8 Design Flight Requirements for Airplane.

The Civil and Military Aeronautics Authorities issue requirements which specify the
design conditions for the various classifications
of airplanes. Generally speaking, any airplane
flight altitude can be defined by stating the
existing values of load factors (acceleration)
and the airspeed (or more properly the dynamic
pressure).
The accelerations on the airplane are produced from two causes, namely, maneuvers and air
gusts. The accelerations due to maneuvers are
subject to the control of the pilot who can
manipulate the controls so as not to exceed a
certain acceleration. In highly maneuverable
military airplanes, an accelerometer is included in the cockpit instruments as a gUide to
limit the acceleration factor. For commercial
airplanes the maneuver factors are made high
enough to safely take care of any maneuvers that
would be required in the necessary flight opera- KU
tions of the particular type of airplane. These
limiting maneuver factors are based on years of an
operating experience and have given satisfactory
results from a safety standpoint without pen-·
alizing the airplane from a weight design consideration.
The accelerations due to the airplane
striking an air gust are not under the control
of the pilot since it depends on the direction
and velocity of the air gust. From much accumulated data obtained by installing accelerometers in commercial and military aircraft and
flying them in all types of weather and locations, it has been found that a gust velocity of
30 ft. per second appears sufficient.
The speed or velocity of the airplane like-    wise affects the loads on the airplane. The
higher the velocity the higher the aerodynamic
wing moment. Furthermore the gust accelerations increase with airplane velocity. Thus, it
is customary to limit the particular airplane to

 NACA Technical Note 2964 (June 1953), proposes that the

airplane mass ratio or mass parameter, 2 W/apcgs, in
which c is the mean geometric chord in feet and g the acceleration due to gravity.

## A4.10 Illustration of Main Flight Conditions.

Velocity-Load Factor Diagram.
As indicated before the main design flight
conditions for an airplane can be given by
stating the limiting values of the acceleration
and speed and in addition the maximum value of
the applied gust velocity. As an illustration,
the design loading requirements for a certain
airplane could be stated as follows: "The
proposed airplane shall be designed for applied
positive and negative accelerations of + 6.0g
and -3.5g respectively at all speeds from that
corresponding to CL up to 1.4 times the
max.
maximum level flight speed. Furthermore, the
airplane shall withstand any applied loads due
to a 30 ft./sec. gust acting in any direction
up to the restricted speed of 1.4 times the
maximum level flight speed. A design factor of
safety of 1.5 shall be used on these applied
loads If In graphical form these design requirements can be represented by plotting load factor and velocity to obtain a diagram which is
generally referred to as the Velocity-acceleration diagram. The results of the above specification would be similar to that of Fig. A4.l4.
Thus, the lines AB and CD represent the restricted positive and negative maneuver load
factors which are limited to speeds inside line
BD which is taken as 1.4 times the maximum
level flight speed in this illustration. These
restricted maneuver lines are terminated at
points A and C by their intersection with the
maximum CL values of the airplane. At speeds
between A and B, the pilot must be careful not
to exceed the maneuver accelerations, since in
general, it would be possible for him to manipulate the controls to exceed these values.
At speeds below A and C, there need be no care

of the pilot as far as loads on the airplane
are concerned since a maneuver producing C
Imax [•]



_A4.7_


would give an acceleration ~ess than the limited values given by lines AB and CD.
The positive and negative gust accelerations due to a 30 ft./sec. gust normal to flight
path are shown on Fig. A4.l4. In this example
diagram, a positive gust is not critical within
the restricted velocity of the airplane since
the gust lines intersect the line BD below the
line AB. For a negative gust, the gust load
factor becomes critical at velocities between F
and D with a maximum acceleration as given by
point E.
For airplanes which have a relatively low
required maneuver factor the gust accelerations
may be critical for both positive and negative
accelerations. Examination of the gust equation
indicates that the most lightly loaded condition
(smallest gross weight) produces the highest
gust load factor, thus involving only partial
pay load, fuel, etc.
On the diagram, the points A and B correspond in general to what is referred to as high
angle of attack (H,A,A,) and low angle of attack
(L.A.A.) respectively, and points C and D the
inverted (H.A.A.) and (L .• A.A.+ conditions respectively.
Generally speaking, if the airplane is designed for the air loads produced by the velocity and acceleration conditions at points A, B,
E, F, and C, it should be safe from a structural
strength standpoint if flown within the specified
limits regarding velocity and acceleration.
Basically, the flight condition requirements of the Civil Aeronautics Authority, Army,
and Navy are based on consideration of specified
velocities and accelerations and a consideration
of gusts. Thus a student understanding the basic
discussion above should have no difficulty understanding the design requirements of these
three government agencies.
For stress analysis purposes, all speeds
are expressed as indicated air speeds. The
"indicated" air speed is defined as the speed
Which would be indicated by a perfect air-speed
indicator, that is, one that would indicate
true air speed at sea level under standard atmospheric conditions. The relation between the
actual air speed Va and the indicated air speed


Vi is given by the equation


Vi =' f§. Va
V Po


where


Vi = indicated airspeed


Va = actual airspeed


Po = standard air denSity at sea level


Pa = density of air in which Va is attained

the loads on the wing should be checked for
cases where the engines are attached to the wing
and are located forward of the leading edge.
In cases where the landing gear is attached
to wing or when the fuel and engines are carried
in and on the wing, the loads produced on the
wing structure in a landing condition may be
critical for some portions of the wing structure
inboard of landing gear and engine attachment
points.

## A4.11 Special Flight Design Conditions.
There are many other flight conditions
which may be critical for certain portions of
the wing or fuselage structure. Most airplanes
are equipped with flaps, to decrease the landing speed and such flaps are lowered at speeds
at least twice that of the minimum landing
speed. Since the flapped airfoil has different
values for the magnitude and location of the
airfoil characteristics, the wing structure
must be checked for all possible flap conditions
within the specified requirement relative to
maximum speed at which the flaps may be operated. Generally speaking, the flap conditions
will effect only the wing portion inboard of the
flap and it is usually only critical for the
rear beam web or shear wall and for the top and
bottom walls of the torsion box. This is due to
the fact that the deflection flap moves the
center of pressure considerably aft thus producing more shear load on the rear shear wall as
well as torsional moment on the conventional
cantilever box metal beam.
The airplane must likewise be investigated
for aileron conditions. Operation of the ailerons produce a different air load on each side
of the airplane wing which produces an angular
rolling acceleration of the airplane. furthermore, the deflected ailerons change the magnitude and location of the airfoil characteristics, thus calculations must be carried out to
determine whether the loads in the aileron conditions are more critical than those for the
normal flight conditions.
For angular acceleration resulting from
pitching moments due to air gusts on the tail,



## A4.12 Example Problems Involving Accelerated Motion of Rigid Airplane.
As previously explained, it is general
practice to place the airplane under accelerated
conditions of motion into a condition of static
equilibrium by adding the inertia forces to the
applied force system acting on the airplane. It
is usually assumed that the airplane is a rigid
body. Several example problems will be presented to illustrate this general procedure.


Example Problem 1
Fig. A4.15 illustrates an airplane landing
on a Navy aircraft carrier and being arrested by
a cable pUll T on the airplane arresting hook.
If the airplane - weight is 12,000 lbs. and the
airplane is given a constant acceleration of 3.5g
(112.7 ft/sec [2] ), find the hook pUll T, the wheel
reaction R, and the distance (d) between the line
of action of the hook pUll and the airplane e.g.
If the landing velocity is 60 M.P.H. What is the
stopping distance.


W = 12000 lb.



![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-77-1.png)

R



Fig. A4.15



Solution: 

On contact of the airplane with the arresting cable, the airplane is decelerated to the
right relative to Fig. A4.15. The motion is pure
translation horizontally. The inertia force is


Ma = ~ g a = (12000) 3 5g g' = 42000 lb    

The inertia force acts opposite to the direction
of acceleration, hence to the left as shown in
Fig. A4.15.
The unknown forces T and R can now be solved
for by using the static equations of equilibrium.


~FX = -42000 + T cos 10° 0



hence,



T = 42700 lb.


-12000 + R - 42700 x sin 10n



o

hence, R = 19420 lb.


To find the distance (d) take moments about c.g.
of airplane,



hence,
Rs = 29800 lb. (up)


~F~ = 29800 - 9000 + R1 = 0



hence, R1 = _ 20800 lb. (acting down)
L:M 19420 x 24 - 42700 d = 0
c.g.
hence, The velocity at end of catapult



19420 x 24 - 42700 d = 0



d = 10.9 in.



The velocity at end of catapult track can
be found from the following equation



Landing velocity Vo = 60 M.P.H. = 88 ft/sec.


V S                       - 0 = 2 x 96.6 x 35


SUbt: - or
v = 82 ft/sec. = 56 M.P.H.



hence stopping distance s = 34.4 ft.


Example Problem 2
An airplane equipped with float is catapulted into the air from a Navy Cruiser as illustrated in Fig, A4.16. The catapulting force
P gives the airplane a constant horIzontal acceleration of 3g(96.6 ft/sec S ). The gross
weight of airplane 9000 lb. and the catapult
track is 35 ft. long. Find the catapulting
force P and the reactions R1 and Rs from the
catapult car. The engine thrust is 900 lb.
What is airplane velocity at end of track run?

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-78-2.png)


Solution: 

The forces will be determined just after
the beginning of the catapult run, where the
car velocity is small, and thus the lift on the
airplane wing and the airplane drag can be
neglected.

Horizontal inertia force acting toward the airplane tail equals,



Example Problem 3
Assume that the transport airplane as illustrated in Fig. A4.17 has just touched down in
landing and that a braking force of 35000 lb. on
the rear Wheels is being applied to bring the
airplane to rest. The landing horizontal velocity is 85 M.P.H. (125 ft/sec). Neglecting air
forces on the airplane and assuming the propeller
forces are zero, what are the ground reactions
R1 and Rs • What is the landing run distance With
the constant braking force?


W = 100,000 lb.



![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-78-1.png)

The airplane is being decelerated horizontally hence the inertia force through the airplane c.g. acts toward the front of the airplane.
Since the braking force is given we can solVe

for the deceleration factor by the eqUilibrium
equation,


~FX = 35000 - Max = [0]

hence,

It is flying horizontally at a velocity of 500
M.P.H. (733 ft/sec) when the pilot pulls it upward into a curved path with a radius of curvature of 2500 ft. Assume the engine thrust and
airplane drag equal, opposite and colinear With

Note if the engine had been forward of the airplane c.g., the inertia force of 776 lb. would
act upward instead of downward.
In calculating the inertia force on a
certain airplane item due to angular acceleration,the equation F = Mra assumes that the
particular item had negligible mass moment of
inert i.a about its own centroidal Y axis. In
the caSe of a large item this centroidal mass

## A4.13 Effect of Airplane Not Being a Rigid Body.

The example problems of Art. A4.12 assume that the airplane is a rigid body (suffers
no structural deformation). On the basis of
this assumption the applied loads on the airplane in either flight or landing conditions
are placed in eqUilibrium with the inertia
forces which occur due to the acceleration of
the airplane. It is obVious that an airplane
structure like any other structure is not a
rigid body, particularly a cantilever wing which
undergoes rather large bending deflections in
both flight and landing conditions. Figure
A4.21 shows a composite photograph taken of a
test wing for the Boeing B-47 airplane. The
maximum upward and downward deflections shown



considerably less than the modulus of elasticity, hence the deflections under the applied
loads would be somewhat less than 2/3 those
shown in the photograph. ThiS photograph thus
indicates very strikingly that a wing structure
is far from being a rigid body.

Static loads are loads which are gradually
applied and cause no appreciable shock or vibration of structure. On high speed aircraft,
air gusts, flight maneuvers and landing reactions are applied quite rapidly and thus can
be classed as dynamic loads. Therefore when
these dynamic loads strike a fleXible (nonrigid) airplane cantilever Wing, a rather large
wing deflection is produced and the wing tends
to Vibrate. This Vibration therefore causes
additional accelerations of the mass units of
the wing which means ad.ditional inertia forces
on the wing. Furthermore if the time rate of
application of the external applied forces
approaches the natural bending frequencies of
the wing, the Vibration excited can produce
large additional wing stresses.


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-82-full.png)

Up until World War II practically all airplanes were assumed as rigid bodies for structural design purposes. During the war failure
of aircraft occured under load conditions which
the conventional design procedure based on rigid
body analysis, indicated satisfactory or safe
stresses. The failures were no doubt due to
dynamic overstress because the airplane is not
a rigid body.
Furthermore, airplane design progress has
resulted in thin wings and relatively large
wing spans, and in many cases these wings carry
concentrated masses, such as, power plants,
bombs, wing tip fuel tanks etc,. Thus the
flexibility of wings have increased which means
the natural bending frequencies have decreased.
This fact together With the fact that airplane
speeds have greatly increased and thus cause
air gust loads to be applied more rapidly, or
the loading is becoming more dynamic in character and thus the overall load effect on the
wing structure is appreciable and cannot be
neglected in the strength design of the wing.


General Dynamic Effect of Air Forces on
Wing Loads.


The critical airloads on an airplane are
caused by maneuvering the airplane by the pilot
or in striking a transverse air gust. A transport airplane does not have to be designed for
sharp maneuvers producing high airplane accelerations in its job of transporting passengers,
thus the time of applying the maneuver loads is
considerably more than a fighter type airplane
pUlling up sharply from high speeds.
Fig. A4.22 shows the result of a pull-Up
maneuver on the Douglas D.C.3 airplane at 180
M.P.H. relative to load factor versus time of
application of load. As indicated the peak
load of load factor 3.25 was obtained at the
end of one second of time.

.5 1 1.5 2


Pull-up of DC-3 Airplane at 180 mph.


The author estimates the natural frequency of
the D.C.3 wing to be around 10 to 15 cycles per
second, thus a loading time of 1 second against
a time of 1/10 or 1/15 for half a wing deflection cycle indicates that dynamic overstress
sqould not be appreciable. In general, it can
be said that dynamic over-stress under maneuvering loads on transport airplanes is not as
great as from other conditions such as air
gusts or landing.


Dynamic Effect of Air Gusts.


The higher the air gust velocity and the
higher the airplane velocity, the less the time



A4.13


for applying the load on the wing when striking
the air gust.
NACA Technical Note 2424 reports the flight
test results on a twin-engine Martin transport
airplane. Strain gages were placed at various
points on the wing structure, and strains were
read for various gust conditions for Which the
normal airplane accelerations were also recorded.
Then slow pUll-up maneuvers were run to give
similar airplane normal accelerations. The wing
had a natural frequency of 3.8 cps and the airplane speed was 250 M.P.H. Two of the conclusions given in this report are: - (1) The
bending strains per unit normal acceleration
under air gusts were approximately 20 percent
higher than those of slow pull-Ups for all measuring positions and flight conditions of the
tests, and (2) The dynamic component of the wing
bending strains appeared to be due primarily to
excitation of the fundamental wing bending mode.
These results thus indicate that air gusts
apply a air load more rapidly to a wing than a
maneuver load giving the same airplane normal
acceleration for a commercial transport type of
airplane, and thus the dynamic strain effect on
the wing is more pronounced for gust conditions.
Figs. A4.23, 24 and 25 show results of dynamic effect of air gusts on a large wing as determined by Bisplinghoff*. The results in these
figures show that dynamic effects tend to considerably increase wing forces on some portions
of the wing and decrease it on other portions.

A4.14 GENERAL LOADS ON AIRCRAFT



It has also been found that landing loads
applied through the conventional landing gear or
by water pressure on a flying boat are applied
rapid enough to be classed as dynamic loads and
such loads applied to wings of large span produce dynamic stresses which cannot be neglected
in the safe design of such structures.


## A4.14 General Conclusions on Influence of Dynamic Loading on Structural Design of Airplane.

The advent of the turbo-jet and the rocket
type engines has opened up a range of possible
airplane airspeeds hardly dreamed of only a few
years ago, and already trans-sonic and supersonic speed airplanes are a common development.
From an aerodynamic standpoint such speeds have
dictated a thin airfoil section which has thus
promoted a high density wing. ThuS for airplanes with appreciable wing spans like Military bombers and near future jet commercial
transports, which usually carry large concentrated masses on the wing such as engines, fuel
tanks etc., the assumption that the airplane is
a rigid body is not sufficiently accurate enough
because the dynamic stresses are appreciab~e.
The calculation of the dynamic loading on
the wing requires that the mass and stiffness
distribution of the wing structure be known.
Since these factors are not known when the
structural design of a wing is started, the
general procedure in design would be to first
base the design on the assumption that the wing
is a rigid body plus correction factors based on
past design experience or available research information to approximately take care of the influence of the elastic wing on the airplane
aerodynamic characteristics and the build up
dynamic inertia forces. With the wing thus initially designed by this procedure, it then can
be checked by a complete dynamic analysis and

modif~ed as the results dictate and then recalculated for the modified elastic wing. This
procedure is now practical because of the availability of high speed computors.
