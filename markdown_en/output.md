**CONTINUOUS STRUCTURES -MOMENT**

**DISTRIBUTION** METHOD   


**Al!.l** **Introduction.** The moment distribution
method was originated by Professor Hardy Cross.**
The method is simple, rapid and particularly
adapted to the solution of continuous structures
of a high degree of redundancy, where it avoids
the usual tedious algebraic manipulations of
numerous equations. Furthermore, it possesses
the merit of giving one a better conception of
the true physical action of the structure in
carrying its loads, a fact which is usually
quite obscure in some methods of solution.
The method of procedure in the Cross method
is in general the reverse of that used ~n the
usual methods where the continuous structure is
first made statically determinate by removing
the continuous feature and the value of the redundant then solved for which will provide the
original continuity. In the Cross method each
member of the structure is assumed in a definite
restrained state. Continuity of the structure
is thus maintained but the statics of the structure are unbalanced. The structure is then
gradually released from its arbitrary assumed
restrained state according to definite laws of
continuity and statics until every part of the
structure rests in its true state of equilibrium.
The general principles of the Cross method
can best be explained by reference to a specific
structure.
Fig. All.l shows a continuous 2 Span beam.
Let it be required to determine the pending moment diagram. We first arbitrarily ass~ that
each span is completely restrained against rotation at its ends. In the example selected ends
A and C are already fixed so no restraint must
be added to these points. Joint B is not fixed
so tnis joint is imagained as locked so it cannot rotate. The bending moments which exist at
the ends of eacn member under the assumed condition are then determined. Fig. All.2 shows the
moment curves for this condition. (For calculation and formulas for fixed end moments see following articles). Fig. All.3 shows the general
shape of the elastic curve under this assumed
condition. It is noticed that continuity of the
structure at B is maintained, however from the
moment curves of Fig. All.2 it is found that the
iRternal bending moments in the beams over support B are not statically balanced, or specifically there is an unbalance of 270. The next
step is to statically balance this joint, so
it is unlocked from its imaginary locked state
and obviously joint B will rotate (See Fig.
All.4) until equilibrium is established, that is,
until resisting moments equal to 270 have been

set up in the two beams at B. The question is
how much of this moment is developed by each
beam. The physical condition which establishes
the ratio of this distribution to the two beams
at B is the fact that the B end of both beams
must rotate through the same angle and thus the
unbalanced moment of 270 will be distributed between the two beams in proportion to their ability of resisting the rotation of their Bend thru
a common angle. This physical characteristic of
a beam is referred to as its stiffness. Thus let
it be considered that the stiffness factors of
the beam BA and BC are such that 162 is distributed to BC and - 108 to BA as shown in Fig. All.4.
(The question of stiffness factors is discussed
in a following article).
Referring to Fig. All.4 again it is evident
that when the elastic curve rotates over joint B
that it tends to rotate the far ends of the
beams at A and C, but since these joints are
fixed, this rotation at A and C is prevented or
moments at A and C are produced. These moments
produced at A and C due to rotation at B are referred to as carry-over moments. As shown by
the obvious curvature of the elastic curves
(Fig. All.4), the carry-over moment is of opposite sign to the distributed moment at the rotating end. The ratio of the carry-over moment
to the distributed moment, referred to as the
carry-over factor, depends on the physical properties of the beam and the degree of restraint
of its far end. (Carry-over factors are discussed in a following article. For a beam of constant section and fixed at the far end, the carry-over factor is -1/2). In figure All.4 a factor of -1/2 has been assumed which gives carryover moments of 54 and -81 to A and C respectively. To bbtain the final end moments we add the
original fixed end moments, the distributed balancing moments and the carry-over moments as
shown in Fig. All.4. With the indeterminate
moments thus determined, the question of shear,
reactions and span moments follow as a matter
of statics.


**All.2** **Definitions** **and** **Derivations** **of** **Terms**

1. Fixed-end moments:
By "fixed end moment" is meant the moment
which would exist at the ends of a member if
these ends were fixed against rotation.

2. Stiffness Factor:
The stiffness factor of a member is a value
proportional ~o the magnitude of a couple that
must be applied at one end of a member to cause
unit rotation of that end, both ends of the
member being assumed to have no movement of

0.5 when far end is fixed. The letter C
will be used to designate carry-over factor.

4. Distribution Factor:
If a moment is applied at a joint where two
or more members are rigidly connected the distribution factor for each member is the proportional
part of the applied moment that is resisted by
that member. The distribution factor for any
member which will be given the symbol D equals

K/~K, where K equals stiffness factor of a particular member and ~K equals the sum of K values
for all the Joint members. The sum of the D
values for any joint must equal unity.

5. Sign Convention:
Due to the fact that in many problems where
members come into a joint from all directions as
is commonly found in airplane structure, the
customary sign convention for moments may produce
confusion in applying the moment distribution
method. The following sign convention is used in
this book: a clockwise moment acting on the end
of a member is positive, a counterclockwise one
is negative. It follows that a moment tending to
rotate a joint clockwise is negative. It should
be understood that when indeterminate continuity
moments are determined by the moment distribution
method using the above adopted sign convention,
that they should be transferred into the convential signs before proceeding with the design of
the member proper.


The following sketches illustrate the adapted sign convention,

will depend in part on the restraint or degree
of fixity of the opposite end of the member
from which the couple is applied. The letter K
is used as a symbol for stiffness factor.

3. Carry-over Factor:
If a beam is simply supported at one end
and restrained to some degree at the other, and
a moment is applied at the simply supported end,
a moment is developed at the restrained end.
The carry-over factor is the ratio of the moment at the restrained end to that at the
simply supported end. For a prismatic beam

AIl.,3 Calculation of Fixed End Moments


Since the fixed end moments are statically
indeterminate1additional facts must be obtained
from the laws of continuity in order to solve
for them. In this book the theorem of area
moments will be used to illustrate the calculation of the fixed end moments as well as the
other terms which are used in the moment distribution method. (Ref. Chapter A7)
The following well known principles or
theorem of area moments will be used:(1) The deflection of any point "A" on the
elastic curve of a beam away from a tangent to
the elastic curve at another point _"B"_ is equal
to the mom~nt of the area of the M diagram beEI
tween the points A and B about point "A".
(2) The change in slope between two points
"A" and _"B"_ on the elastic curve of a beam is
equal to the area of the M diagram between the
EI
two points "A" and "B".
The "area moment" theorems will be illustrated by the applications to the solution of a
simple problem. Fig. All.5 shows a simply supported beam of constant moment of inertia and
modulus of elasticity carrying a single concentrated load. Figs. All.6 and All.7 show the
static moment curve and the shape of the beam
elastic curve. Now assume that the ends are fixed as shown in Fig. All.8 and let the value of
the fixed end moments be required. Fig. All.9
shows the shape of the final moment curves made
up of the static moment curve and the unknown
trapizoidal moment curve formed by the unknown
end moments. Fig. All.10 shows the shape of the
elastic curve, the slope at the two supports being made zero by fixity at these points.

Since the change in slope of the elastic
curve between ends (1) and (2) is zero, theorem
(2) as applying to fixed end beams can be restated as follows.
The sum of the areas of the moment diagram
must equal zero. And from theorem (1) the static moment of the areas of the moment diagram
about any point must equal zero or in equation
form:



The values of M~ and M 2 for any value of a or b
can now be found by solving equations (3) and (4)

Thus the carryover factor for a beam fixed at
its far end is 1/2. Using the conventional moment signs, the carryover moment is of thA opposite sign as shown by the above equation, However, for our adopted sign convention inspection
of the shape of the elastic curve as shown in
Fig. All.14 tells us that the sign of the carryover moment is of the same sign as the rotating
moment at the near end. That is, the moment acting on each end of the member is in the same direction, and therefore of the same sign.

A comparison of the stiffness factor of this

ness factor of a beam freely supported at its
far end is 3/4 as great as one fixed at its far
end. Furthermore in one case the carry-over
factor is zero and in the other case it is 1/2.
It is therefore obvious that the values of these
two terms depends in part upon the restraint
or degree of fixation of the far end of the
beam.


AII.5 General Expressions for Stiffness and Carryover Factor in Terms of Fixation Factor (F)
at Far End of a Beam

In the beam of Fig. All.14 (F) fixation
factor at A was unity since beam had been taken
as completely fixed at A. It was found that:

MB = 4EI8B and MA = - 2 EI 8B

L L

Then 8B = unity and let EI = K for simplici ty.

L

Then MB = 4K

MA = -2K
Likewise the results for the beam of Fig. All.13
give

MB = 3K
MA =0

Figs. All.15 and All.16 show these results.
Fig. All.17 shows the general case, the fixation factor at A being F. The difference between Figs. All.15 and All.17 is that the slope
at end A has changed but 8B the slope at end B
remains the same.

AII.5a Example Problems


To obtain a definite conception of the true
mechanics of the "Cross" method, the reader is
advised to follow thru the detailed solution of
the following simple problems. In these problems, the moment of inertia in any span has been
taken as constant and all joints have been assumed to undergo no translation. Problems involving variable I and joint translation will be
considered later.

Example Problem 1 shows a two-span continuous beam With over-hanging ends. We first assume all the joints B, C and D to be locked
against rotation or the beams BC and CD are
arbitrarily assumed in a fixed-end condition.
The first line in the solution gives the
stiffness factor of each beam. From Art. All.5
the general expression for stiffness factor is
EI (3 + F)/L, where F = fixation factor of far end
which equals 1, since all joints have been considered fixed. Thus, stiffness factor K = EI
(3 + l)/L = 4 EI/L. Since EI/L is the same for
each span BC and CD, the stiffness factor has
been written as one since it is only the relative values that are necessary. The cantilever
BA has zero stiffness.
The second row gives the member distribution
factor D at each joint or D = K/ZK. For example
at joint B, the distribution factor to BA = 0/(1 +
0) = 0 and to BC = 1/(1 + 0) = 1. At joint C, the
distribution factor to CB = 1/(1 + 1) = .5 and
likewise to CD.
The third row gives the carry-over factors.
From Art. All.5, the carry-over factor C = 2F/(3 +
F) = 2 x 1/(3 + 1) = .5 assuming the far end fixed
or F = 1 fo~ each member.
The next step as shown by the 4th horizont
al row is the calculation of the fixed end moments. The signs or the moments are according to
our adopted sign convention, that is an internal resisting moment which tends to rotate the


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-245-full.png)

Al1.6 THE MOMENT DISTRIBUTION METHOD



end of a member clockwise is positive.
We now begin the solution proper by first
unlocking joint B from its assumed fixed state.
We find a moment of -883 on one side and 768 on
the other side of joint or a static unbalance
of -115. Joint B therefore will rotate until a
resisting moment of 115 is set up in the members
BA and BC.
The resistance of these members to a rotation of Joint B is proportional to their stiffness. The distribution factor based on the
stiffness factors is 0 for BA and 1 for BC.

Thus 1 x 115 = 115 is distributed to BC at Band
o x 115 = 0 to BA. Joint B is now imagined as
again locked against rotation and we proceed to
Joint C, which is now released from its assumed
locked state. Since the joint is already statically balanced, no rotation takes place and the
distributing balancing moment to each span is
zero. Next proceed to joint D, and release it.
The unbalanced moment is, 115 so the joint is
balanced by distributing -115 between DE and DC
as explained above for joint B.
As pointed out in Art. All.5, when we rotate one end of a beam it tends to rotate the
far fixed end of the beam by exerting a moment
equal to some proportion of the moment causing
rotation at the near end. For beams of constant
section and fixed at their far ends, the carry
over factor is _1/2_ as explained before. Thus
the distributing balancing moments in line 4
produce the carry-over moments as shown in line
5 of the table. This completes one cycle of the
moment distribution methOd, which is repeated
until there is nothing to balance or carry-over,
or in other words until all artificial restraints
have been removed and the structure rests in its
true state of eqUilibrium.
To continue with the second cycle, go back
to joint B and release it again from its assumed
locked state. There is no unbalance since the
carryover moment from point C was zero, thus
there is nothing to distribute or carry-over.
Proceed to point C, releasing the joint, we find
it balanced under the carry-over moments of 57.5
and -57.5. Thus the distributing balancing moments are zero. Joint D is likewise in balance
since the carry-over moment from C is zero. All
joints can now be released Without any rotation
since all joints are in equilibrium. To obtain
the final moments we add the original fixed end
moments plus all distributed balancing and carry over moments.


All~6 General Summary of Proceedure

1. All computations should be written on, or
adjacent to the diagram of the structure.
2. Determine the stiffness factor K for each
end of each member. K = (3 + F) EIIL, where F
is the degree of fixity at far end of member.
If all members are assumed fixed at far end then
K is proportional to IlL assuming E as constant.
3. Determine the distribution factor D for each
member at each joint of structure. D = K/~K.



4. Calculate the carry-over factor C for each
end of all members C = _2F/(3_ + F). Thus for
beams fixed at far end F = 1 and thus C = _112._
For pinned at far end F = 0, hence C = O.
5. Calculate the fixed end moments (f) for given transverse member loadings or support deflections, using equations in summary Table All.l.
End moments which tend to rotate end of beam
clockwise are positive moments. (See Art. All.2)
6. Considering one joint at a time, unlock it
from its assumed fixed state, all other joints
remaining locked. If an unbalanced moment exists balance it statically by distributing a
counter acting moment of opposite sign among the
connecting members according to their D or distribution factors.
7. These distributed balancing moments produce,
carryover moments at far-end of members equal to
the distributed moment times the carry-over factor C and of the same sign as the distributed
moment. Record these carry-over moments at far
ends for all distributed moments.
8. Repeat the proceedure of unlocking each
joint, distributing, and carrying over moments
until the desired precision is obtained, stopping
the solution after a distribution. The final
moment at the end of any member equals the algebraic sum of the original fixed end moments and
all distributed and carryover moments.

Example Problem 2 is similar to problem 1 but two
spans have been added. We first assume all joints
locked against rotation. The stiffness factor of
each span is proportional to EIIL or _llL_ since EI
is constant. The carry-over factor is _1/2_ as in
previous example. Fixed end moments are calCUlated as shown. Unlock joint B, the unbalanced moment is -115. Balance the joint by distributing
1 x 115 to BC and zero to BA. Proceed to joint C,


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-246-full.png)

and unlock, all other joints remaining fixed
against rotation. The unbalanced moment is
(-768 + 432) = - 336. Balance by distributing
.428 x 336 = 144 to CB and .572 x 336 = 192 to
CD. Proceed to joint D, and release. The unbalanced moment is zero which means that joint
D is in equilibrium, thus no distribution is
necessary. Proceed to joint E and F and balance
in a similar manner. The distributed moments
will be the same as the values for joints Band
C due to symmetry of structure and loading,
however, the signs will be opposite under our
adopted sign conventions. The next step is the
carry-over moments Which are equal to 1/2 the
distributed balancing moments. This operation
is shown clearly in the table. Values of all
moments are given only to first decimal place.
The first cycle has now been completed. Cycle
two is started by again releasing joint B. We
find the joint has been unbalanced by the carryover moment of 72. Balance the joint by distributing - 72 x 1 = - 72 to BC and zero to BA.
Proceed to joint C. The unbalanced moment is
57.5. Balance by distributing - 57.5 x .428 =
- 24.6 to CB and the remainder - 32.9 to CD.
Proceed to joint D. There is no unbalance at
this joint since the carry-over moments are in
balance, thus no distribution is necessary.
Proceed to joints E and F in a similar manner.
The carryover moments equal to 1/2 of the
2nd set of balancing distributed moments are now
carried over as shown in the table. The second
cycle has now been completed. This operation
has been repeated five times in the solution
shown, or until the values of the balancing and
carryover moments are qUite small or negligible.
The final moments equal the algebraic summation
of the original fixed end moments plus all distributed and carryover moments. One requirement of the final end moments at any joint is
that the algebraic sum must equal zero. The
other requirement consistant with the common
slope to all members at any joint is given by
equation (5) of Art. All.8. The results at
joint C will be checked using this equation.

Simplifying Modifications - Example Problem #3


The solution as given in Problem #2 represents the "Cross" method in its fundamental and
most elementary detailed form. Many modifications of the general method have been presented,
in the most part for the purpose of eliminating
part of the arithmetic or the number of cycles



**All** **7**


necessary. These modifications usually involve
rather long expressions for expressing the stiff
ness and carryover factors of a member in terms
of the fixation given by adjacent members. It is
felt that it is best to keep the method in its
simplest form which means that very little is to
be remembered and then the method can be used infrequently Without refreshing ones mind as to
many required formulas or equations.
There are however several qUite simple modi
fications which are easily understood and remembered and which reduce the amount of arithmetic required considerably.
For example in Problem #2, joints Band F
are in reality freely supported, thus it is needless arithmetic to continue locking and unlocking
a joint which is definitely free to rotate.
Likewise due to symmetry of structure and loading it is only necessary to solve one half of the
structure. Due to symmetry joint D does not ro
tate and thus can be considered fixed, which
eliminates the repeated locking and unlocking of
this joint.
A second solution of Problem #2 is given in
Example Problem #3. As before we assume each
joint locked and calculate the fixed end moments.
Now release or unlock joint B and balance as ex
plained in previous example #2. Before proceed
ing to joint C, carryover to C from B the carry over moment equal to 115 x 1/2 = 57.5. Joint
B is now left free to rotate or in its natural
condition. Proceed to joint C and unlock. The
unbalanced moment = (-768+432+57.5) =- 278.5 or
278.5 is necessary for equilibrium. This moment
is distributed between two beams, CD which is
fixed at its far end D and CB which is freely
supported at the far end B. The stiffness factor is equal to (3 + F) EI/L (See Art. All.5).
Hence for CD stiffness factor = (3 + 1)
EI/L = 4 EI/L. For CB stiffness factor = (3 + 0)
EI/L = 3 EI/L or in other words the stiffness of
a beam freely supported at its far end is 3/4
as great as when fixed at its far end. Thus the
stiffness factor of CB at C is .75 x .0104 =
.0078. The carry-over factor C to B is zero
since B is left free to rotate. (See Art. All.5)

All.S THE MOMENT DISTRIBUTION METHOD



The stiffness factor of the fixed support is infinity, that is a rigid support has infinite resistance to rotation.
Joint C is now balanced by distributing
278.5 x .36 = 100.1 to CB and 278.5 x .64 = 178.4
to CD. Now carryover to joint B, 0 x 100.1 =
o and 0.5 x 178.4 = 89.2 to D. Proceed to joint
D and release it from its assumed locked state.
The unbalanced moment is -432 + 89.2 = - 342.8,
we balance by distributing 342.8 between DC
which has a stiffness of 0.139 and the support
E which has an infinite stiffness or zero goes
to DC and 342.8 goes to rigid support. The carry over moment to C from D is zero since 0.5 x
o = O. The final moments thus equals the summations as shOwn Which of course are equal to th
results shown in Problem #2.


Example Problem #4


Problem 4 is similar to Problem #2 and #3,
except that the support at D is assumed as having 50 percent fixity. Thus 50 percent of any
moment at this point produces rotation of the
member DC at D.
In continuous wing beams, which fasten together by fittings on a support, it is commonly
required that the beam be considered as being
fully continuous and also that the degree of
continuity be taken as 50 percent. Solution 1
of Problem 4 is a detailed solution. The only
change that has been made is in the stiffness
factor of the support E, which has been taken
as equal to the beam DC, thus any unbalanced
moment at this point is equally divided between
the beam and the support.
Solution 2 is a modified solution which
eliminates considerable arithmetic. Thus it is
unnecessary to lock and unlock joint Band D
since we know definitely that one is freely supported and the other 50 percent fixed. Therefore, once we have releasee these joints from
their assumed fixed end state, we leave them in
their natural state. The stiffness and carryover factors for beams CB and CD must then be
determined for these beams with their modified
end conditions.
By reference to the fundamental equations
for stiffness and carryover factors in Art.
All.5, it is readily seen that the stiffness
factor for CB is 3/4 as much as when fixed at
its far end B and the carryover moment is zero.
For beam CD the stiffness is 7/8 as much as when
fixed at end D, and the carryover factor is
2F/3 + F = (2 x .5)/3 + .5 = .286. With these
modifications the solution is carried thru With
a relatively small number of steps. Thus in
solution #2, joint B is unlocked. The unbalanced moment of -115 is balanced statically by
distributing 115 to BC. The carry-over moment
of .5 x 115 = 57.5 is carried over to C as shown.
Joint B is now left unlocked or free to rotate.
Joint D is unlocked next. The unbalanced moment
is -432. It is balanced by distributing 216 to
DC and 216 to E since support at E is considered
to give 50% fixity. The carry-over moment of

equals (-768 + 432 + 57.5 + 108) = - 170.5, or
170.5 is necessary for equilibrium. Joint C is
balanced by distributing .392 x 170.5 = 66.8 to
CB and the remainder of 103.7 to CD. The carryover moment to B is zero and to D it equals
103.7 x .286 = 29.6. The final moments in solution #2 are slightly different than solution #1.
If another cycle had been added in solution #1
the discrepancy would be considerably smaller.


All.7 Continuous Beams with Yielding or Deflected
Supports     

In wing, elevator and rudder beams the support points usually deflect due to the deformation of the supporting struts or wires in the
case of a wing, or to the deflection of the
stabilizer or fin in the case of elevator and
rUdder beams. If these beams are continuous this
deflection of their support points causes additional bending moments in the beams. The moment
distribution method can of course be used to find
the additional moments due to this deflection.
Thus Example Problem #5, shows a solution illustrating a problem which involves the deflecting
of the supports of a continuous beam. Due to
symmetry of structure and loading, the slope at
D is zero or the beam may be considered fixed at

Joint Do Since the moment of inertia is constant and the spans are constant, the relative
stiffness factor of the beam is 1. In the solution shown since beam is freely supported at
B this joint is left free to rotate after releasing and thus the stiffness factor of beam
CB is 3/4 x 1 = 3/4, when compared to one llaving
fUll fixity at B.
Since the first step in the solution proper
is to assume the joints fixed against rotation,
it is evident that deflecting one support relative to an adjacent support will produce moments at the ends which are assumed fixed against
rotation.

To make this equation consistent with the assumed sign convention, that is, the carryover moment has the same sign as the balancing distributed moment, the above equation must be modified as follows:

are not practicable because of the large number
of equations that must be solved to obtain values for the many unknowns.

Solution for Condition I, Fixed at Ends A and B

Referring to Fig. All.20, all joints are
assumed locked against rotation or fixed. The
vertical axle load of 6000# produces a counterclockwise moment of 3 x 6000 = 18000 in. lb.
about joint O. The sign is positive (See Art.
All.2). Release or unlock joint 0, the unbalanced moment is 18000 or - 18000 is required
for static equilibrium of joint O. Joint 0 is
balanced by distributing - 18000(.464/.464 +
.369) =-10030 to member OB and the remainder or
or -18000(.369/.464 + .369) = -7970 to OA.
These distributed balancing moments at 0 produce
carryover moments at A and B.
Thus carryover to B, .5 x - 10030 = - 5015
and carry over to A, .5 x - 7970 = - 3985
Proceeding to joint A which is a fixed joint,
the unbalanced moment of -3985 is balanced entirely by the rigid support, or no rotation
takes place when joint is released from its imaginary fixed state. Similar action takes place
at joint B. The final end moments are as
shown in the Figure.

Solution for Condition II. End A and B Pinned


For this condition the ends A and Bare
freely supported. Instead of locking and unlocking these joints which are definitely known
to be free



All. 11


to be freely,supported, they will be left in
their true state. Thus the carryover moments
from end 0 will be zero. Since A and B are both
pinned, the relation between the relative stiffness factors of members OA and OB remain the
same as in condition I, thus the same K or
stiffness factors that were used in condition I
can be used in distributing moments at joint O.
Joint 0 is balanced in same manner as condition
I but with zero carryover moments to A and B.

Solution for Condition III. A is 50% Fixed and
B is Pinned.

Since each member has a different degree of
fixity at its upper end, the stiffness and carry
over factors will be considered in detail. In
condition I since both members were fixed at
their upper ends the relative stiffness factor
of each member was proportional to I/L for the
member and this ratio was used. The general expression for stiffness factor is K = EI (3 + F)/L
carryover factor 2F. For member OA, F
3+F
equals .5 since A is 50% fixed, and for member
OB, F is zero since B is freely supported. Hence
for member OA


K=E{(3+ .5) =3.~ EI=3.5X3~105 E= .0129 E


C.O. Factor from 0 to A = 2 x .5 = .286

3 + .5

For member OB


K = E{ (3 + 0) = 3 x • ~~ x E = .0139E


C.O. Factor From 0 to B = 2 x 0 = 0

3 + 0


Considering joint 0 in Fig. All.20 the external
moment of 18000 in.lb. is balanced by distributing - 18000 between the two members in proportion
to their stiffness factors. Hence - 18000 (.0129/
.0129 + .0139) = -8650 in lbs. is resisted by OA
and the remainder of -18000 (.0139/ .0129 + .0139)=
-9350 to OB. The carryover moment from 0 to A =
.286 x -8650 = -2475 and zero from 0 to B. (See
Fig. A1L20)


Example Problem #7

Fig. All.21 shows a structure composed of 3
members. Member AO is subjected to a transverse
load of 120# at its midpoint. Joint A is fixed,
B is freely supported, C is 25 percent fixed
and joint 0 is considered to maintain continuity
between all members at O. The end moments on
the three members due to the transverse loading
on member AO will be determined.

Solution #1. Fig. All.2l gives a solution using
the "Cross" method in its fundamental unmodified
state. The solution is started by assuming all
three members as fix-ended. The relative stiffness factor K of each member is therefore proportional to I/L of each member. These K values
are listed in Fig. All.21. The distribution

factor D for each member at each joint which
equal K/ZK is recorded in Don each member
around each joint. Thus any balancing moment
is distributed between the joint members as per
these distribution factors. The carryover
factors for all members is 1/2. The fixed end
moments due to external loading are computed
for the three members. For member AO, the fixed end moments equal PL/8 = 120 x 20/8 = 300 in.
lb. The other two members having no transverse
loading, the fixed end moments are zero.
In this solution the order of joint consideration has been AOBC and repeat. starting
with joint A the joint is released but since
the member AO is actually held by a fixed support, no rotation takes place and the balancing
moment of 300 is provided entirely by the support and zero by the member AO. The carryover
moment C, to 0 is zero. Releasing joint 0, the
unbalanced moment of 300 is balanced by distributing - 300 between the three members according to their D values, thus - 300 x .416 =

- 125 to OA; - 300 x .168 = - 50 to OC and

- 125 to OB. To prevent confusion it is recommended that a line be drawn under all distributed balancing moments, thus any values above
these lines need not be given further consideration and only values below the lines need
be considered in later balancing of the joints.
Immediately after distributing the moments at
joint 0 the proper carryover moments should be
taken over to the far end of each member, thus
 - 62.5 to A, - 62.5 to Band - 25 to C. Joint
B is next considered. The unbalanced moment is
-62.5 and it is balanced by distributing 62.5
to BO since the pin support has zero stiffness,
or no resistance to rotation. A line is drawn
under the 62.5 and the carryover moment of
31.25 is placed at O. Joint C is considered
next. The unbalanced moment of -25 is balanced

by distributing .75 x 25 = 18.75 to CO and the remainder of 6.25 to the support, since the fixity of
the support at C has been assumed as 25 percent. A
line is drawn under the 18.75 and the carryover
moment of 9.37 is taken over to O. One cycle has
now been completed. Returning to joint A, we
find -62.5 below the line. This is balanced by
distributing zero to OA and 62.5 to the fixed
support. A line is drawn under the zero distributed moment to AO and the carryover moment of
zero is placed at O. Considering joint 0 for
the second time the unbalanced moment is 9.37 +
31.25 + 0 = 40.62 or the sum of all values below
the column horizontal lines. The joint is balanced by distributing - 17 to OA and OB and
-6.62 to OC. Lines are drawn under these balancing moments as shown in Fig. All.2l and the
carryover moments are taken over to the far
ends before proceeding to joint B.
This general process is repeated until joint
A has been balanced 5 times and the other joints
4 times each, as indicated in the figure the distributing values have become qUite small and it
is evident that a high degree of accuracy has
been obtained. The final end moments at each
joint equal the algebraic sum of the values in
each column. A double line is placed above the
final moments as a distinguishing symbol. In
the figure the letters band c refer to balancing
and carryover moments, the subscripts referring
to the member of the balancing or carryover
oneration. Any order of joint consideration can
be used in reaching the same result.

Solution #2 of Problem 7

Fig. All.22 gives a second solution. With
the end conditions known at A, Band C, the modified stiffness factors of the members can be .
found together With the modified carryover factors, thus making it necessary to balance joint
o only once and carryover this final far end

All. 14 THE MOMENT DISTRIBUTION METHOD



Fig. All.24 gives the solution of the
problem. The procedure in this solution was as
follows:
The stiffness factor K for each member as
computed in Table All.2 is recorded in the circles adjacent to each truss member. The carry
over factors for all members is 1/2 except for
modified members GI, FI and FH for which the
carryover factor to the 50% fixed ends is .286.
The distribution factor for each member at each
joint is recorded at the end of each member, and
equal s K/L:K.

The next step in the solution is to compute
the fixed end moments due to the transverse
loads on members.
For member BE
MBE = Pab 2 /L 2 = 120 x 29.25 x 12 2 /41.25 2 = -al8"


MEB = 120x 29.25 2 x 12/41.25 2 = 725"#


2 2
McD =100 x 20 X 10/30 = - 445


2 2
MDC = 100 x 10 X 20/30 =222

These moments are placed at the ends of the
members on Fig. All.23 together with the eccentric jOint moments. The process of unlocking
the joints, distributing and carrying over moments can now be started. In the solution as
given the order of joint consideration is
ABCDEFG and repeat, and each joint has been balanced three times.
Consider joint A:Unbalanced moment = 2400. Balance by distributing - 2400 as follows:To AC 2400 x .527 = -1268. Carryover
to C = -634
To AB 2400 x .473 = -1132. Carryover
to B = -566


Proceed to Joint B:Unbalanced moment (-566 + 3200 - 298) =
2336. Joint is balanced by distributing - 2336
to connecting members as follows:To BA = - 2336 x .569 = - 1330. Carryover to
A - 665
To BC = - 2336 x .310 = - 724. Carryover to
C - 362
To BE = - 2336 x .121 = - 282. Carryover to
E - 141

The convenient device of drawing a line
under all balancing moments is used to prevent
confusion in later balances of the joint.


Proceed to Joint C:Unbalanced moment = (-634   - 362 - 445) = -1441
The joint is balanced by distributing 1441 as
follows:To CA = 1441 x .44 = 635. Carryover to A = 318
CB = 1441 x .214 = 309. Carryover to B= 155
CE = 1441 x .064 = 92. Carryover to E =46
CD = 1441 x .282 =406. Carryover to D= 203
This process is continued for the remainder of
the truss joints. After all joints has been
balanced once, on returning to joint A we find
below the lines an unbalanced moment of (318665) = -347. The joint is balanced a second time



by distributing 183 to AC and 164 to AB with
carryover moments of half these values to ends
C and B respectively.
The student should now be able to check the
rest of the solution as given on Fig. All.24.
The solution could be made with any order of
joint consideration. If any particular joint appears to be nearly balanced, it is best to skip
it for the time being and consider those joints
which are considerably unbalanced.
The final moments at the end of each member
are given below the double lines.


Example Problem #9

Fig. All.25 represents a cross section of a
welded tubular steel fuselage. The top and bottom members which are web members in the top and
bottom fuselage trusses are subjected to the
equipment installation transverse loads as shown.
Let it be required to determine the end bending
moments in the rectangular frame due to these
transverse loads assuming full continuity thru
joints.

Solution:


Fig. All.26 shows the solution. The distribution factors based on the member stiffness factors are shown inDat ends of each member. The
first step is to compute the fixed end moments
due to transverse loads, on members AB and CD using equations from Table All.l. The magnitudes
are 1890"# for AB and 2025"# for CD.
Joint B is now released from its assumed
fixed state. The unbalanced moment of 1890 is
balanced by distributing - 1890 x .247 = - 467 to
BA and the remainder of -1423 to BD. The carry
over moment to A = - 465 x .5 = - 233. Due to
symmetry of structure and loading only one half
of frame need be considered and hence these carry over moments to A are not recorded. However,
in balancing joint A it will throw over to B the
same magnituae of carryover moments as thrown
over to A from B but of opposite sign since the
original fixed end moment at B is minus. Thus
233 comes to B from first balance of A as shown
in the figure. The distributing moment to B of
-1423 produces a carryover moment of -1423 x .5=
-712 at D. ~ 27"

All. 16 THE MOMENT DISTRIBUTION METHOD



identical to Fig. All.30c. For
the conditions of support assumed,
the deflection of A away from a
tangent to the elastic curve at B
is zero. Thus by the deflection
principle of area moments, the
moment of the Mil diagrams of
Figs. All.30 (a and b) about
end A equals zero. Thus,
845.7x14.1+ 7~08 MBx24.4=0

or


MB = - 66"#

Since MA was assumed 100, then
carryover factor from A to B =
-66 = - .66.

100
To find carryover factor from B
to A, take moments about Band
equate to zero.
Hence
845.7
743.8x 15.6 + 100 MAx 25.9 = 0

whence


MA = - 53.2"#

Therefore carryover factor B to
A = - 53.2 = - .532

100

(Note: For the moment sign convention used in this book carry
over factor would be plus.)

The value 100 in the denominators is due to the
fact that trial values of 100 were assumed for
MA and MB' Solving equations (7) and (8) we
obtain;


MA = - 315"# and MB = - 785"#.


(B) Calculation of Carry Over Factors


To determine the carryover factor from A to
B consider end A as freely supported and B as
fixed. A moment MA = 100 is applied at A which
produces the Mil curve of Fig. All.30b. Due to
the deflection of the beam under this loading a
restraining moment at B to cause tangent of
elastic curve to remain horizontal will exist.
This unknown fixed moment at B has arbi trarlly
been taken as 100, thus producing a _Mil_ curve



When a beam is freely supported at one end A and fixed at
the far end B, the stiffness factor at the A end is measured by
the moment necessary at 'A to produce unit rotation of the elastic curve at A.
In Art. All.4 it was proved for beams of
uniform section that EGA = MAL/41 or MA = 4EIGAI
L. In a continuous structure at any joint all
members have the same G, thus 4EG is constant
and the stiffness K of any prismatic beam is
proportional to IlL. For beams of variable
section the stiffness factor K may be written:

K= c lolL   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - (9)

where 1 0 is the moment of inertia at a particular reference section and c is a constant to be
found for each non-uniform member. Thus for
non-uniform members


EGA = MALI 4cI 0   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   - (10)


By the moment area slope principle, the
slope at A when B is fixed equals the area of
the Mil diagram between A and B.
Taking MA = 100, MB was found to equal
-66"#. Thus EGA = 4(845.7- .66x743.8) =1419.
The value 4 is due to the strip width since
true area is wanted and only average ordinate
was used in Table All.3.
Equating this result to Equation (10)


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-256-full.png)

All. 17



1419 = 100 x 40, whence c = .707
4c xl
1 0 was taken as the value at the A end or 1.
(See Fig. All.27).
Therefore KAB = .707 IA/L

Similarly for end B:100x40
EGB = 4(743.8 -' .532 x 845.7) = 4c xl

whence


c = .85 and KBA = .85 IA/L



Example Problem 1.

Fig. All.33 shows a single bay rectangular
bent carrying a distributed side load on one
leg as shown. The K or I/L values for each
member are given on the figure.
Under the given loading it is obVious that
the frame will sway to the right or in other
words, joints Band C will undergo considerable
horizontal movement. The moment distribution
method assumes that only joint rotation takes
place. To make this assumption true for this
structure we will add an imaginary support at
joint C which will prevent sidesway of the frame
as illustrated in Fig.All.34. The end moments
in the frame will then be found by the moment
distribution process. Fig. All.34 shows the
results of this process. To explain, the solution begins With computing the fixed end moment
on member AB = WL 2/12 = (300 x 25 2)/12 = 15.63
thousands of foot Ibs. This value with the
proper sign is written at the head of a column
of figures on member AB as shown in Fig.All.34.
Now considering Joint B, the unbalanced
joint moment of 15.63 is distributed as follows:To Member BA =- 15.63 (40/190) =- 3.27. Carry
over to Joint A =- 3.27/2 =- 1.63


To Member BC =- 15.63 (150/190) =- 12.36. Carry over to Joint C =- 12.36/2 =- 6.18

Now consider Joint C:The unbalanced moment is -6.18. To balance we distribute to CB = 6.18 x 150/190 =
4.88. Carryover to B = 2.44; to CD = 6.18 x
40/190 = 1.30. Carryover to D = 0.65


The balancing and carryover procedure is now
repeated for joints Band C, until the unbalanced moments become of negligible magnitude.
Fig.All.34 shows that 4 cycles have been carried through. By keeping the ratio 150/190 set
on the slide rule the unbalanced moments at
joints Band C are distributed and chased back
and forth as rapidly as one can write them
down. Since joints A and D are assumed fixed,
they absorb moments but do not give out any.


Fig. All.35 shows a free body diagram of
each portion of the frame. The end moments
are taken from the results in Fig. All.34.
Consider member AB as a free body. To find
the horizontal reaction HB we take moments
about point A.


m A = 300x 25 x 12.5 + 11750 -17570  - 25HB = 0


hence HB = 87930/25 = 3517 lb.


Now consider member CD as a free body.
To find HC take moments about D.


~MD = 1530 + 770 - 25Hc = 0, hence HC = 89 lb.


We now place these horizontal forces on the
top member BC as a free body as shown in the
upper portion of Fig. All.35. The unknown
imaginary reaction RC at point C that was
added in Fig. All.34 to prevent sidesway is
also shown. To find RC take ~Fh = 0


ZFh = 3517 + 89 -He = 0, hence He = 3606 lb.


Since the external reaction of 3606 does
not exist, we must eliminate it and find the
bending moments due to the sidesway of the
frame. In other words, the frame will sway
sideways until bending of the frame develops a



horizontal shear reaction at the upper end of
the vertical legs of the frame equal to 3606 lb.


Bending Moments Due to 8idesway.


Assume the structure sways sideways as
illustrated in Fig. All.36, but with no
rotation of the upper joints. It was proven
in Art. All.8 that the end moments produced by
the lateral movement of one end of a beam whose
ends are fixed against rotation are equal to
6EId/L [2] where d is the lateral movement. In
Fig. All.36 the load P causes both vertical
members to suffer the
same horizontal displacement at their
upper ends, hence their
end moments due to this
displacement are pro- 2 Fig. All. 36

member in our structure, Rotation of Joints
the fixed end moments will
be the same magnitude for
each member. Therefore, for convenience we will
assume fixed end moments of 10,000 ft.lbs. are
produced by the sidesway. We now use the moment
distribution process in permitting the upper
joints to rotate as illustrated in Fig. All.37.
The procedure is similar to that in Fig. All.34.
For example the solution is started by considering joint B. The unbalanced moment is -10.
This is balanced by distributing 10 x 150/190 =
7.89 to BC and the remainder of 2.11 to BA.
The carryover moments are 7.89/2 = 3.95 to C
and 2.11/2 = 1.06 to A. Due to symmetry of
loading and structure, the distributing and
carryover moments at joint C will be same as
at joint B, hence it is needless work to show
calculations at these joints. The carryover
moments from C to B will be identical to those
from B to C. Fig. All.37 shows the 5 cycles
have been carried out to obtain the final end
moments as shown below the double lines.

Fig. All.38 shows a free body diagram of
the frame vertical members with the end moments
as found in Fig. All.37. The shear reactions
HB and He are each equal to (8470 + 9230)/25 =
708 lb. These shear reactions are then placed
on the free body of member BC in Fig. All.38.
For equilibrium the summation of the horizontal
forces must equal zero. Thus P = 708 + 708 =
1416 lb. and acting to the right as shown in
Fig. All.38. Since the reaction He = -3606 in
Fig. All.35 must be liquidated and since the
liquidating force P produced by the moments in
Fig. All.37 is 1416 lb. it is obvious the
values in Fig. All.37 must be multiplied by a
factor equal to 3606/1416 = 2.545. Therefore,
the final bending moment values equal those of
Fig. AIl.34 plus 2.545 times those in Fig.
All.37. Fig. AIl.39 shows the results and

The distribution factors for each member at

For Member AB = PL/8 = 100 x 24/8 = 300 in .lb.
For Member BC = PL/8 = 100 x 16/8 = 200


As explained in example problem 1, the
moment distribution is carried out in two steps,
one for joint rotation only and the uther for
effect of sidesway or horizontal translation of
joints Band C. Fig. All.41a shows the moment
distribution for no sidesway by placing an
imaginary reaction He at joint C. The process
is started at joint A and the order of joint
balancing is ABCBC. As soon as a joint is
balanced the carryover moments are immediately
carried over before proceeding to the next
joint. When a joint is balanced a horizontal
line is drawn.

All. 20 THE MOMENT DISTRIBUTION METHOD



With the end moments known the reaction
He can be calculated by a consideration of the
free body of each member as shown in Fig.
Al1.4lb.

To find HB take moments about A,


100x12+362.3-24HB = 0, HB = 65 lb.


To find HC take moments about D,


-47.3 + 15Hc = 0, HC = 3. 15


Placing these shear reactions on member BC
and writing equilibrium of horizontal forces
we find that RC = 65 - 3.15 = 61.85 lb. We
now must liquidate this reaction RC and permit
frame to sidesway.


We will assume that the frame is fixed
ended and that an unknown horizontal force P
at C will deflect the frame sideways. The
fixed end moments for equal horizontal deflection of Band C will be proportional to
EI/L& of the vertical member.

For convenience we will assume 417 in. lb. as
the fixed end moments on AB and 445 on DC.
The assumed fixed ends will now be eliminated
by the moment distribution process as shown
in Fig. All.41c. The order of joint balance
was ABDCBCBC.


Fig. All.41d shows the shear reaction on
the vertical members at Band C. These forces
reversed on the top member show an unbalanced
force of 6.02 + 10.85 = 16.87 lb. Therefore
a force P = 16.87 was necessary to produce the
bending moments that resulted on the frame
due to sidesway.

To liquidate the reaction RC = 61.85 it
will therefore require 61.85/16.87 = 3.67 times
the moments in Fig. All.41c. Therefore the
final bending moments equal those in Fig.
All.41a plus 3.67 times those in Fig. All.41c.
Fig. All.41e shows the results. The bending
moment and shear diagram and the axial loads
now follow as a simple matter of statics.

Example Problem 3. Bending Moments in Truss
Involving One Panel Without Diagonal Shear
Member.


Frequently, in aircraft structures a truss
is used in which a diagonal member must be left
out of one or more truss bays. The external
shear load on such bays must be carried by the
truss chord members in bending. Fig. All.42
shows a 3 bay truss with no diagonal member in
the center bay. The bending moments on the
truss members will be determined for the truss

SOLUTION:


The relative moment of inertia values
for each member are given in the circles on
the truss in Fig. All.42.


The distribution factor to each member
at each joint is then computed and equals

K/~K. The values are recorded in thec=J
on each member in Fig. All.43. The stiffness
factor K is proportional to IlL for the member.
For example for joint c: 

1 7
+-=60 60



All. 21


Then the distribution factors are: 

To Member cb = _4/7_   - .57


To Member cf = _1/7_ = .14


To Member cd = _2/7_ = .29


In this problem there are no loads applied
to the members between joints. The external
shear load on the truss to the right of the
center truss panel which equals 10 + 10 = 20
must be carried through the center panel by the
truss chord members in bending. This bending
causes the center truss to sway or deflect
until a resisting shear force equal to 20 is
developed.


We will assume the truss center panel is
fixed at joints b, c, f, and g. The right end
of this assumed fixed ended truss will be given
an upward deflection. This deflection will
cause fixed end moments in members bc and gf
which are proportional to IlLS for each member.
Since L is the same for each member, the fixed
end moments will be proportional to I of the
member.

All. 22 THE MOMENT DISTRIBUTION METHOD



Therefore the fixed end moments on member
gf will be 75 percent of those on member bc.


Assume 100 as the fixed end moments on
bc. Then a 75 x 10 = 75 is the accompanying
fixed end moment on gf.


We now remove the imaginary fixed supports
on the center truss and let them rotate to
equilibrium by the moment distribution process
as shown in detail in Fig. All.43.


The first step is to record the assumed
fixed end moments of 100 at each end of member
bc and 75 at each end of member gf with due
regard for sign. The moment distribution process will be started at joint C. The unbalanced moment is 100 or -100 is necessary for
static balance. Using the distribution factors on joint C, we find -57 goes to cb, -29
to cd and -14 to cf. Short lines are drawn
below each of these numbers. Fifty percent of
these balancing moments are carried over to
the far end of each of these members. This
process is repeated at each joint until the
remaining balancing moments are negli~ible.
In Fig. All.43 the order of joint balance was
cfdebghacfdebghacfdebg. If the student will
follow this order he should be able to check
the figures in Fig. All.43.



Fig. All.44 shows
free bodies of the truss
members bc and gf with
end moments from Fig.
All.43. The shear reaction at ends c and f
by statics equals

1.377 + 1.045 = 2.422 lb.


The external truss shear at line cf = 20 lb.
Therefore it will take 20/2.422 = 8.25 times
the final bending moments as found in Fig.
All.43 to develop a bending shear reaction
of 20 lb. Thus the final moments are 8.25
times those in Fig. All.43.


The solution as given neglects the effect
of axial loads upon the value of the stiffness
and carryover factors. Art. All.12 explains
how to include these effects.


All. 12 Effect of Axial Load on Moment Distribution


In the previous articles the effect of
axial loads upon the member end moments of a
continuous structure was neglected. The axial
loads produce bending in the members of a continuous structure in two ways. (1) The shortening or lengthening of the various members due



to axial loads produces translation of the
joints of the structure. Since the angles between the members at a joint remain the same
due to continuity, this translation of joints
bends the members between joints. (2) The
bendirg moments on the members due to external
joint or lateral loads or those due to joint
rotation produce lateral deflection of the
members between joints. The member axial loads
times these lateral deflections produce
secondary moments. These secondary moments can
be handled by the general method of moment
distribution however the stiffness and carry
over factors and the fixed end moments are not
constant but become functions of the axial
loads.


Fig. All.45 shows a prismatic beam simply
supported at A and fixed at B, with a moment
MA applied at A and carrying an axial compressive load P. Sub. Figure a, band c show the
3 parts which make up the moment diagram on the
beam. Without the axial load P the portion (c)
would be omitted.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-261-0.png)


MOMENT DIAGRAMS


Fig. A'll. 45


By definition the stiffness factor of beam
AB is measured by the necessary moment MA to
produce unit rotation (9:: 1) for elastic line at
point A. By the moment area principles, the
slope at A equals the shear at A due to the
moment diagrams acting as a load on a simply
supported beam at A and B. For a given unit
slope at A it is obvious that the required MA
is less When the load P is acting as it produces a moment load in (Fig. c) of the same sign
as the moment load due to MA. Thus the stiffness of AB is less when carrying an axial compressive load compared to that witho~t it. For
a tension axial load diagram C becomes a negative moment diagram and thus MA must become
larger to give unit slope at A. Or in other
words a member carrying a tensile axial load
has a greater stiffness than one without axial
loads. It is evident that the moment diagram
due to P will also effect the magnitude of any

All.13 Fixed End Jloaents, Stiffness and Carry
over Factors for **Beaa** Columns of Constant
Section     
In deriving expressions for fixed end moments, stiffness and carryover factors the beam
columns formulas of Chapter A5, must be used
in finding slopes, deflection and moments.
Mr. B. W. James in an excellent thesis at
Stanford University and later published by N.A.
C.A. as Technical Note #534 has derived expressions for these factors and has provided graphs
of these factors for use in routine design.
Figures All.46 to All.56 inclusive are taken
from this thesis. The use of these Figures can
best be illustrated by the solution of several
problems.


All.14 Illustrative Probleas:**

Example Problem #12

Fig. All.57 shows the same continuous beam
as used in Example Problem #4 (and solution #2).
For this example it has been assumed that such
axial compression loads exist in spans BC and CD
as to make the term L/j = 2.5 and 2.0 for these
spans respectively, where j = vEI/P. Due to the
axial loads, new values of stiffness and carry
over moments as well as fixed end moments must
determined as follows.

Span BC
I 1
K = L = 96 = .0104


From Fig. All.47 when L/j = 2.5, correction factor for stiffness factor = .775 when far end is
fixed and .36 when far end is pinned. Hence,


**KBC** **=** **.0104** **x** **.775** **.00806**


KeB = .0104 x .36 .00374

From Fig. All.46, when L/j = 2.5 the carryover
factors are CBC = .73 and CCB = 0 1f B is considered freely supported.


From Fig. All.48 when L/j = 2.5 fixed end moments for uniform load = wL [8] /lO.67 = 1 x 96 [8 ] /
10.67 = 865 in. lb.

Span CD


K = I/L = 1/72 = .0139, L/j = 2.0
From Fig. All.47 correction factor = .86, hence
KeD = KDC = .86 x .0139 = .01198. Carryover
factor from Fig. All.46 = .62. Fixed end moment
from Fig. All.48 = WL [2] /l1.2 = 1 x 72 [2] /11.2 = 462
The distribution factor at joint C equals
(.00374/.00374 + .01198) = .238 to CB and the
remainder .762 to CD.
The balancing and carryover process is
s1mllar to that in Example Problem 1/4.

Comparing these results with those of Problem #3
we find moment at C is increased 15.7 percent
and that at D is decreased 8.5 percent. For
larger values of L/j the difference would be
greater.


Example Problem #13

Fig. All.58 shows the upper wing of a bIplane. The wing beams are continuous over 3
spans. The distributed air loads on the front
beam are shown in the figure, also the axial
loads on front beam induced by the lift and drag
truss. The bay sections of the spruce are shown
in Fig. All.58. The moment of inertia in each
span will be assumed constant, neglecting the
influence of tapered filler blocks at strut
points.



Fig. **All.** **59**


Fig. All.59 shows the total beam axial loads in
the various portions of the beam by adding the
values shown in Fig. All.58. The outer span AB
due to the axial loads induced by drag wires of
drag truss is subjected to a varying load. As is
customary in design of such wing beams the axial
load in span AB will be taken as equal to the
average load or (-9571-8565-7559)/3=-8565#.
The beam bending moments at the support
points will be determined by the moment distribution method.
Calculation of Factors:

Span AB


I = 17.21, L = 100, I/L .172


E = 1300,000, P = 8565

j =~=~300,0~~6~ 17.21 51.1


L/j = 100/51.1 = 1.96


From Fig. All.47 when L/j = 1.96, correction
factor = .86 for fixed far.end and .52 for pinned far end. Therefore


KAB .52 x .172 .0895


KBA = .86 x .172 .148

From Fig. All.46, when L/j = 1.96, the carryover
factors are:

C.O'BA = .62, and zero from A to B since B
is considered in its true state or freely supported. From Fig. All.48 when L/j = 1.96 equation for fixed end moment for uniform load
WL 2 /11.25 = 32 x 100 2 /11.25 = 28420"#.
The overhand moment MBC = 60 x 26.6 x
(32 + 16)/2 = 38300"#.
Center Span AA' :

I = 22, I/L = 22/84 .262, P = - 11758
j =~,300,000 x 22 49.4
11758

Solution:
The magnitude of the axial loads in the
members is influenced by the unknown restraining
moments at A and B. To obtain a close approximation of the axial loads, the end moments in
the two members will be determined Without consideration of axial loads. Thus the external
joint moment of 4 x 18000 = 72000 in. lb. at C
is distributed between the two members as shown
in Fig. All.62. With the member end moments
known the axial loads and shear reactions at A
and B can be found by statics. The resulting
axial loads are


PAC = 7360# and PBC = - 24240# and the
shear reactions, SA = 198# and BB = 2332#.


With the axial loads known the modifted
beam factors can be determined.

Effect on End Moments Due to Translation of
Joint C Due to Axial Loads.


The movement of joint C normal to each
member will be calCUlated by Virtual work.
(Reference Chapter A7). Fig. All.64 shows the
Virtual loading of 1# normal to each member at C.
The Table shows the calculation of the normal deflections at C.

Thus the deflection of joint C normal to

the unit load, and the deflection of C normal to

The fixed end moments due to support deflection equals M = 6Eld/L [2] as derived in Art.

The signs are minus because inspection shows
that the moments tend to rotate ends of members

for these moments. The magnitude of the moment
at B is 6.7 percent of that in Fig. All.63 and
10.4 percent at Joint C, however, it is relieving" in this example.

All. 15 Secondary Bending Moments in Trusses with
Rigid Joints.     
Often in airplane structural design trusses
with rigid joints are used. Rigid joints are
produced because of welding the members together
at the truss joints or by the use of gusset
plates bolted or riveted to each member at a
truss jOint. When a truss bends under loading
the truss joints undergo different amounts of
movement or deflection. Since the truss members
are held rigidly at the joints, any joint displacement will tend to bend the truss members.
The bending moments produced in the truss members due to the truss joint deflections are
generally referred to as secondary moments and
the stresses produced by these moments as
secondary stresses.


Since fatigue strength is becoming more
important in aircraft structural design, the
question of secondary stresses becomes of more
importance than in the past. The moment distribution method provides a simple and rapid method
for determining these secondary moments in truss
members due to truss deflection. The general
procedure would be as follows: 

(1) Find the horizontal and vertical displacements of each truss joint due to the critical design condition. (See Chapter A7 for
methods of finding truss deflections).


(2) From these displacements, the transverse
deflection of one end of a member with
respect to the other can be found for each
truss member.


(3) Compute the fixed end moments on each member
due to these transverse displacements.


(4) Calculate stiffness and carry-over factors
for each truss member.


(5) Calculate distribution factors for each
truss joint.


(6) Carry out the moment distribution process
to find the secondary moments at the ends
of each member.


(7) Calculate the stresses due to these secondary moments and combine with the primary
axial stresses in the truss members due to
truss action with pinned truss joints.


All.16 Structures with Curved Members.

The moment distribution method can be applied to continuous structures which include
curved as well as straight members. The
equations for finding the stiffness factors,
carryover factors and fixed end moments for
straight members cannot be used for curved members. The elastic center method as presented

Also see Chapter C2, Part H.



![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-267-1.png)
![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-268-full.png)

in Chapter A9 provides a rapid and simple
method for determining these values for curved
members. The use of the elastic center method
in determining the value of stiffness and
carryover factors will now be explained.


AIl.l7 Structures with Curved Members.


Before considering a curved member a
straight member of constant EI will be considered. Fig. All.66 shows a beam freely

supported at end A and fixed at end B. A
moment MA is applied at end A of such magnitUde as to turn end A through a unit angle of
one radian as illustrated in Fig. All.66. By
definition, the necessary moment MA to cause
this unit rotation at A is referred to as the
stiffness of the beam AB. In Art. All.4 it
was shown that this required moment was equal
in magnitude to -4EI/L. It was also proved
that this moment at A produced a moment at
the fixed end B of 2EI/L or a moment of one
half the magnitude and of opposite sign to
that at A. Fig. All.67 shows the bending
moment diagram which causes one radian rotation of end A. Fig. All.68 shows the M/EI
diagram, which equals the moment diagram
divided by EI which has been assumed constant.


The total moment weight 0 as explained
in Chapter A9 equals the area of the M/EI
diagram. Thus 0 for the M/EI diagram in
Fig. All.68 equals,

_- i_ (~) + ~ (~) = -2 + 1 = -1


In other words the total elastic moment
weight 0 equals one or unity.


The location of this total moment weight
o will coincide with the centroid of the M/EI



All. 29


diagram. Thus to find the distance x from B
to this centroid we take moments of the M/EI
diagram about B and divide by 0 the total area
of the M/EI diagram. Thus


Thus the centroid of the total moment weight 0
which equals one lies at point A or a distance
L to left of B.


In using the elastic center method to determine the stiffness and carry-over factor for
a straight beam, we assume that the bending
moment curve due to a moment applied at A is of
such magnitude as to turn the end A through an
angle of 1 radian. As shown above, the moment
weight 0 for this loading is unity or 1 and its
centroid location is at A. Then by the elastic
center method we find the moment required to
turn end A back to zero rotation. The value of
this moment at A will then equal the stiffness
factor of the beam AB. In order to simplify
the equations for the redundant forces the
elastic center method refers them to the elastic
center. From Chapter A9 the equations for the
redundant forces at the elastic center for a
structure symmetrical about one axis are: 

M [o ]  - _ -2: 2: dS/EI 0 s  - - - - - - - - - - - (1)

Fig. All.69 shows beam of Fig. All.66 replaced by a beam with the reaction at end A
replaced by a rigid bracket terminating at
point (0) the elastic center of the beam, which
due to symmetry of the beam lies at the midpoint of the beam. The elastic moment loading
is 0 s = 1 and its location is at A as shown in
Fig. All. 69.

By definition the stiffness factor is the

is the stiffness factor and this result
checks the value as previously derived in
Art. Al1.4.


The bending moment at B in Fig. All.70
equals,



is removed and end A is connected by a rigid
bracket terminating at the elastic center of
the structure. We will now find the required
forces at (0) to cancel the unit rotation at A
which was assumed in Fig. All.71.



The total area of the M/EI curve for the
curve in Fig. All.72 if calculated would equal
one or unity as explained in detail for a
straight member. The centroid of this M/EI
diagram would if calculated fall at point A.
Thus in Fig. All.73 we apply a unit 0s load at
A and find the redundant force at O. Due to
symmetry of structure about a vertical or y
axis the elastic center lies on this symmetrical
axis. The vertical distance from base line AB
to elastic center equals y = .6366r. (See
page A3.4 of Chapter A3).


The elastic moments of inertia Ix and Iy

Therefore the stiffness factor for a halfcircular arch of constant EI is 2.314- EI/r.


The carry-over factor equals the ratio of
MB to MA or (-1.04-2 EI/r)/(-2.314- EI/r) =
0.452. It should be noticed that the carryover moment has the same sign as the applied
moment at A as compared to the opposite sign
for straight members. In other words, there
are two points of inflection in the elastic
curve for the curved arch as compared to one
for the straight member.


FIXED END MOMENTS


The fixed end moments on a curved member
for any external loading can be determined
quite rapidly by the elastic center method as
illustrated in Chapter A9 and thus the explanation will not be repeated here.


The student should realize or understand
that when the end moments on a straight member
in a continuous structure are found from the
moment distribution process, the remaining
end forces are statically determinate, whereas
for a curved member in a continuous structure,
knowing the end moments does not make the
curved member statically determinate, since
we have six unknowns at the two supports as
illustrated in Fig. All.75 and only 3 equations
of static equilibrium. Even when
the end moments Fig. **All.** **75**
are determined
from the moment
distribution
process there
still remains
one unknown,
namely the horizontal reaction
at one of the
beCLll ends.



Fig. All.76 shows I = 1
a frame consisting of
both straight and
curved members. Although simplified L=60" C
relative to shape, I = 2
this frame is somewhat
representative of a
fuselage frame with two L=80" L=80"

floor loads. The frame F f-'- ........ """'---'''--''--''-' ......... "'''-"'--'''---j D
supporting forces are
assumed provided by
the fuselage skin as 1= 2
shown by the arrows
on the side members. E
Eccentricity of these
skin supporting forces Fig. **All.** **76**
relative to neutral
axis of frame member is neglected in this simplified example problem, since the main purpose of
this example problem is to illustrate the application of the moment distribution method to
solving continuous structures involving curved
members.



SOLUTION


Due to symmetry of structure and loading,
no translation of the frame joints takes place
due to frame sidesway.


The frame cross members AC and FD prevent
horizontal movement of joints A, C, F, and D
due to bending of the two arches. Any horizontal
movement of these joints due to axial deformation is usually of minor importance relative to
causing bending of frame members. Therefore it
can be assumed that the frame joints suffer
rotation only and therefore the moment distribution method is directly applicable.

Carry-Over Factors: 

For the straight members the carry-over
factor is 0.5 and the moment sign is the same
as the distributed moment when the sign convention adopted in this chapter is used.


For a half circular arch of constant I,
the carry-over factor was derived in the previous article and was found to be 0.452. The
sign of this carry-over moment was t he same
sign as the distributed moment at the other
end of the beam. However, using the sign
convention as adopted for the moment distribution in this book, the carry-over factor
would be minus or of opposite siGD to the



Calculation of Fixed End Moments.


The curved members of the frame have no
applied external loadings hence the fixed end
moments on the curved members is zero.


For member AC, fixed end moment equals
WL [2] /12 = 10 x 60 [2] /12 = 3000 in. lb. and for
member FD = 50 x 60 [2] /12 = 15000 in.lb.


Since the supporting skin forces on the
side members have been assumed acting along
centerline of frame members, the fixed end
moments on members AF and CD are zero.

of frame and loading, the process need only be
carried out for one-half of frame, thus in Figure All.7?, only joints A and F are considered
since the numerical reSUlts at D and C would be
the same as at A and F respectively. In the
figure the distribution factors are shown in


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-272-full.png)

the c=J at each joint. The process is started
by placing the fixed end moments with due regard to sign at the ends of members AC and FD,
namely, -3000 at AC, 3000 at CA, -15000 at FD
and 15000 at DF. We now unlock joint A and
find an unbalanced moment of -3000 which means
a plus 3000 is needed for static balance.
Joint A is therefore balanced by distributing
.512 x 3000 = 1536 to AC, .296 x 3000 = 880 to
ABC, and .192 x 3000 = 576 to AF. Short horizontal lines are then drawn under each of these
distributed values to indicate that these are
balancing moments. Carry-over moments are
immediately taken care of by carrying over to
joint F, .5 x 576 = 288. From A to C the
carry-over moment would be .5 x 1536 = 768 and
therefore the carry-over from C to A would be
.5(-1536) = -768 which is recorded at A as
shown. For the arch member ABC, the carry-over
moment from A to C would be -0.452 x 880 =
-401 (not shown) and therefore from C to A =
-0.452 x (-880) = 401 as shown at joint A in
the figure for arch member CBA. Joint C in
the figure has been balanced once for the
purpose of helping the student understand the
sign of the carry-over moments which flow to
the left side from the right side of the frame.


After balancing joint A and taking care
of the carry-over moments, we imagine A as
fixed again and proceed to joint F where we
find an unbalanced moment of -15000 + 288 =
-14712, thus plus 14712 is necessary for
balancing. The balancing distribution is .255
x 14712 = 3750 to FED, .663 x 14712 = 9750 to
FD and .082 x 14712 = 1212 to FA. The carryover moments are .5 x 1212 = 606 to A, .452 x
3750 = 1695 from D to F by way of the arch
member and -.5 x 9750 = -4875 from D on member
FD. We now go back to joint A which has been
unbalanced by the carry-over moments and repeat
the balancing and carrying-over cycle. In the
complete solution as given in Figure All.77
each joint A and F was balanced five times.
The final bending moments at the ends of the
members at each joint are shown below the
double short lines.


The arch member ABC has 3 unknown forces
at each end A and C or a total of 6 unknowns.
With 3 equations of static equilibrium available plus the known values of the end moments
at A and C as found from the moment distribu-.
tion process, the arch member is still statically indeterminate to one degree. Thus the
horizontal reaction at A or C as provided by
the axial load in member AC must be found before the bending moments on arch ABC can be
calculated.


The first step in this problem is to find
the elastic center of the frame portion composed of members ABC and AC, as shown in Fig.
All.78, and then find the elastic moments of



All. 33


inertia about x and y axes through the elastic
center.

The next step in the solution is to draw
the bending moment curves on this frame portion
due to the given load on member AC and the end
moments as found by the moment distribution
process in Fig. All.77. It is composed of
three parts labeled (1) to f3) in Fig. All.79.
Portions (1) and (2) are due to the end moments,
and portion (3) due to the distributed lateral
load on member AC.

Having determined the fixed end moments,
distribution and carry-over factors, the moment
distribution can now be carried out. Fig.
All.89 shows the solution. The first cycle will
be explained. Starting at joint (A) the unbalanced moment is -3000 - 652 = - 3652. The
joint is balanced by distributing .432 x 3652
= 1543 to AC; .364 x 1543 = 1333 to ABC and
.212 Y 3652 = 776 to AD. The carry-over moment
from C to A = .5(-1543) = -772; from C on
member CBA to A =- .452(-1332) = 601; and from
A to D = .5 x 776 = 388. Now proceeding to
joint D the unbalanced moment is -7500 + 388 =
-7112. The joint is balanced by distributing
.75 x 7112 = 5340 to DE and the remainder 25
per cent = 1772 to DA.

the horizontal reaction on the arch at A must

All. 38 THE MOMENT DISTRIBUTION METHOD



The bending moment at any point on member
AC or ABC equals the values in Fig. All.90
plus those due to Mo and Xo in Fig. All.91.


Thus at point A on member ABC,
MABC = 584-2356+181x12.97 = 584 in. lb.
which is the same as found by the moment distribution process.


At point B on arch:   

MB from Fig. All.90 = 584 + 4000 = 4584


MB from Fig. Al1.91 = -2356 -181 x (30 - 12.97)

= -5476

Hence MB = 4584 - 5476 = -892 in.lb.


STRUCTURES WITH JOINT DISPLACEMENTS


For unsymmetrical frames or for frames
loaded unsymmetrically, the assumption that
only joint rotation occurs may give resulting
moments considerably in error. Joint displacement can be handled in a manner as
previously explained and illustrated for frames
composed of straight members.


The distribution of the skin supporting
forces on the frame boundary are usually taken
as following the shear flow distribution for
the shell in bending as explained in a later
chapter.

CHAPTER Al2


**SPECIAL** **METHODS -** **SLOPE** **DEFLECTION METHOD**



A12.1 General. The slope-deflection method is Fig. A12.1a
another widely used special method for analyzing all types of statically indeterminate
beams and rigid frames. In this method as in
the moment distribution method all joints are
considered rigid from the standpoint that all
angles between members meeting at a joint are
assumed not to change in magnitude as loads Fig. b
are applied to the structure. In the slope
deflection method the rotations of the joints
are treated as the unknowns. For a member
bounded by two end joints, the end moments can
be expressed in terms of the end rotations.
Furthermore for static equilibrium the sum of Fig. c
the end moments on the members meeting at a
joint must be equal to zero. These equations
of static equilibrium provide the necessary
conditions to handle the unknown joint rota- Fig. d
tions and when these unknown joint rotations
are found, the end moments can be computed
from the slope-deflection equations. The advantages of the slope deflections method will Fig. e
be discussed at the end of the chapter after
the method has been explained and applied to
problem solution.

A12. 2 Derivation of Slope Deflection Equation.



The problem is to determine the relationships between the displacements of the end
supports of a beam and the resulting end
moments on the beam.


Fig. A12.1a shows a beam restrained at
ends 1 and 2. It is assumed unloaded and of
constant cross-section or moment of inertia.
This beam is now displaced as shown in Fig. b,
namely, that the ends are rotated through the
angles 8 4 and 8 s plus a vertical displacement
d 4 and d s of its ends from its original position, which produces a relative deflection ~
of its two ends. The angle 0 representing the
swing of the member equals ~/L.


The problem is to derive equations for
M 4 and M s in terms of the end slopes 8 4 and
8 s, the length of the beam and EI. Figs. c,
d and e illustrate how the total beam deflectio
in Fig. b is broken down into three separate
deflections. In Fig. c, the end (2) is considered fixed and a moment Mi is applied to
rotate end (1) through an angle 8 4, In Fig.d,
end (1) is considered fixed and a moment M~ is
applied at (2) to rotate end (2) through an
angle 8 s • In Fig. e, both ends are considered
fixed and end (2) is displaced downward a

distance ~ which causes end moments M'~ and M":, In deriving the slope deflection equations each
of the three beam deflections will be considered
separately and the results are then added to
give the final equations. Fig. A12.2 shows Fig.
c repeated.

assumed also positive, as the algebraic solution will determine the true sign of M~.


Two moment area theorems will be used in
deriving the slope-deflection equations,
namely (I) that the change in slope of the
beam elastic curve between two points on the
beam is equal in magnitude to the area of the
M/EI diagram between the two points, and (II)
the deflection of a point (A) on the elastic
curve away from a tangent to the elastic curve
at (B) is equal in magnitude to the first
moment about A of the M/EI diagram between (A)
and (B) acting as a load.



Fig. A12.6 shows the moment diagram for an
applied bending moment -M~ which rotates end (2)
through an angle 8 2 when other end (1) is fixed
(See Fig. A12.5). In a similar manner as
described before,


e = (-M~L/2) (-M~L/2) =   - (Wi + M~)L

2 EI + EI 2EI        - (5)


Taking moments of M/EI diagram about (2),

or,    - M~ = 2M1    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    - (6)



In Fig. A12.2 since 8 2 = 0, then 8 1 will
equal the area of the M curves divided by EI. whence,


8 1 [=] [ (MiL/2)] [ +] [ (MkL/2)] [ =]   -   - (1) 8 2 = 2EI MilL and M~ -_ 2EI8L 2   -   -   -   -   - -   - (7)

The deflection of end (1) away from a
tangent at (2) equals zero, thus we take
moments of the moment diagram about (1) and
equate to zero.


whence -Mk = Mi/2 - - - - (2)

Substituting results in equation (2) in

MODIFIED SIGN CONVENTION



(15)


(16)



Equations (15) and (16) have been
developed using the conventional si~ns for
bending moments. In general there ~re advantages of using a statical sign convention
as was used in the moment distribution method
in Chapter All. Therefore, the following
sign convention will be used in this chapter: 

(1) The rotation of a joint or member is positive if it turns in a clockwise direction.


(2) An end moment is considered positive if it
tends to rotate the end of the member
clockwise or the joint counterclockwise.


This adopted sign convention is the same
as adopted for the moment distribution method
(See Art. All.2).


When equations (15) and (16) are revised
for this new sign convention they become: 


M 1 - 2 == 2K (28 1 + 8 2 -30) +MF 1

(18a)


M 2-1 = 2K (28 2 + 8 1 ) + MF 2  -  -  -  - (18b)


A12.3 Hinged End. Slope Deflection Equation.


Consider that end (2) of beam 1-2 is freely supported or in other words hinged. This
means that M 2 -:L is zero. Thus equation (18)
can be equated to zero.


M 2 - 1 = [2K] [ (28] 2 [+] [ 81.] [ -30)] [ +MF] 2 = [0]


whence


2K8" = -K8 1 + 3K0    -    - 5MF 2


Substituting this value in equation (17)

The signs as shown are determined from the
fact that the end moment at (1) tends to rotate
the end of the member counterclockwise which is
a positive moment according to our adopted sign
convention. By similar reasoning the fixed in
moment at (2) is positive because the moment
tends to rotate end of member clockwise. For
span 2-3: 

MF 2 _ 3 [=] [ wV/12] [ =] [ 24x24] 2 /12 = -1152 in.lb.

will be considered unity.

A12.5 Loaded Continuous Beam with
Yielding Supports.


The movable control surfaces of an airplane,
namely the elevator, rudder and aileron are
attached at several points to the stabilizer,
fin and wing respectively. These supporting
surfaces are usually cantilever structures and
thus the supporting points for the movable control surfaces suffer a displacement thus promoting a continuous beam on yielding or deflected

take care of this support displacement as
illustrated in the following example problem.

deflected supports.
Fig. **A12.15**


Fig. A12.14 is representative of an elevator beam attached to deflecting stabilizer
structure at the five reaction points as
indicated in the figure. The elevator beam
is a round aluminum tube 1-1/4 - .049 in size.
The moment of inertia (I) of this tube equals
0.03339 and the modulus of elasticity (E) of
the material equals 10 million psi. The air
load on the elevator beam is variable as
indicated in Fig. A12.14.


Fig. A12.15 shows the shape of the deflecting supporting structure, which means
that supports (2) and (3) move downward through
the distances indicated on the figure. The
problem will be to determine the bending
moment at the supports under the combined
action of transverse loading and settling of
supports.


SOLUTION: 

Calculation of fixed end moments: 

For a trapeqoidal loading as shown in
Fig. a, the fixed end moments are,


I1 .. _~ - 60 (5u _ L" + 3v)



40"
I1 F 4-3 = -60 (5 x3.5 + 1.5) = 507


The beam has a constant section, hence,
K for all spans equals,


K = EI/L = (10,000,000xO.03339) 40 = 8347


Calculation of 0 values.


Span 2-3. The settlement of support (2)
with respect to support (3) = (0.5 - .1875) =
.3125 inches = ~


o = - ML =- .3125/40 = - 0.007812 rad.


(Since (2) moves counterclockwise with respect
to (3) the sign of 0 is negative.


Span 3-4. ~ = .1875 inches

o =- ML = - .1875/40 =- .004688 rad.


Since the beam, external loading and support
settlement is symmetrical about support (4), the
slope of the beam elastic curve at (4) is horizontal or zero and therefore 6 4 = O. Thus only
one-half of the structure need be considered in
the solution. Due to the fact that (2) is a
simple support with a cantilever overhang, the
moment I1 .. _~ is statically determinate and equals
5x3x3.33 = 50 in.lb. Then for static equilibrium of joint (2), I1 .. - 3 must equal - 50.


Substitution in slope deflection equations
(17) and (18): 

I1"_ 3 = 2K(26 .. + 6 3    - 30) + I1F "-3

   - 50 = 2 x 8347 [26 .. + 6 3   - 3( .007812)J - 426

whence I1 3 _ .. = 333886 3 + 166946 .. + 831 - - - - (2)

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-283-1.png)

SUbstituting in these
equations for the loading Fig. a whence I1 3 - 4 = [333888] 3 - 259 - - - - - - - - (3)
values as shown in Fig.
A12.4, I1 4 - 3 = 2K(28 4 - 6 3 - 30) + I1F 4-3

I1F .. _ 3 = 60 (5x3+ 1) =-426 in.lb.



M..-3 = 2 x 8347 [0 + 6 3    - 3(-.004688)J + 507


whence I1 4 - 3 [=] [ 166940] 3 [+ 742] - - -,... - (4)



For static equilibrium of joint (3),

40 ..
I1F 3-4 = -60 (5x3.5+ 1) = .. 494 I1 3 -,. + I1 3 - 4 = [ 0,] [ hence]


333886 3 + 166946,. + 831 + 33388~                          - 259 = 0

whence, 667766" + 1669462 + 572 = 0 - - - - - (5)


Solving equations (1) and (5) for 82 and
8" we obtain 82 = 0.00439 and 8" =- 0.00967.


SUbstituting in equations (2), (3) and (4)
gives the moments at these points.

M"_2 = 33388 (-.00967) + 16694x .00439

8~ = - 82 and 8" =- 84, which fact will shorten
M"_4 = 33883 (-.00967) 259 = -582 the solution.



M4 -" = 16694 (-.00967) + 742 = 580


Converting these signs to the conventional
signs would give M2 = - 50, M" = - 582 and
M4 =-580.


A12.6 Statically Indeterminate Frames.
Joint Rotation Only.


The slope deflection equations can be
used in solving all types of framed structures.
In frames as compared to straight continuous
beams, the aXial loads in the members are
usually more important, however the influence
on joint displacement due to axial deformation
of members is relatively small and is therefore usually neglected in most simple framed
structures. To illustrate the slope-deflection
method as applied to frames, the structure
shown in Fig. A12.16 will be solved.

A12.7 Frames with Joint Displacements.


In the previous example problems, the
conditions were such that only joint rotations
took place, or if any transverse joint displacement took place as in the example problem
of Art. A12.5, these displacements were known,
or in other words the value of 0 in the slopedeflection was known.


In many practical frames however, the
joints suffer unknown displacements as for
example in the frame of Fig. A12.18. The term
o = ~/L in the slope-deflection equation was
derived on the basis of transverse displacement of the member ends when both ends were
fixed. Thus in Fig. A12.18 under the action
of the external loads, will sway to the right
as magnified by the dashed lines. Neglecting
any joint displacement due to axial deformation, the upper end of each member will move
through the same displacement~. Then we can
write,

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-285-3.png)


Fig. _A12.18_



Due to the fixity at joints (1), (3) and
(5), 8~-s = 8 3 - 4 = 8~-6 = O. Therefore, the
unknowns are 8s-~, 8 4 - 3 [,] 8 6 - 6 and ~.


There are three statical joint equations
of equilibrium available, namely,


Ms-~ + M S - 4 = [0,] [ M] 4 [_] S [+] [ M] 4 [-] 6 [=] [ 0,] [ and]


M6- 4 + M6-~ = 0


Another equation is necessary because there are
four unknowns. This additional equation is
obtained by applying the equations of statics
to the free bodies of the vertical members.
Fig. A12.19 shows the free bodies.

Treating each member separately, we take
moments about the upper end and equate to zero
and then solve for the horizontal reaction at
the bottom end. The reSUlts are,


With these horizontal reactions known the
static equation ZH = 0 can now be applied to
the frame as a whole, which gives,


(20)


Equation (20) is generally referred to as
the bent or shear equation and is an equation
that supplies the necessary extra condition to
take care of the additional unknown ~.

Relative values of 0: 

Due to the sloping members, the relative
transverse deflections of each member are not
as obvious as when the vertical members are connected to horizontal members as in the previous
example. In this example, jOints (1) and (5)
are fixed. Because of symmetry of frame and
loading, joints (2) and (4) will move outward
the same distance ~ as indicated in Fig. A12.24.
Furthermore, due to symmetry, joint (3) will
undergo vertical movement only.


In Fig. A12.24, draw a line from point (2')
parallel to 2-3 and equal in length to 2-3 to
locate the point (3"). Erect a perpendicular
to 2'-3" at 3" and where it intersects a vertical
through (3) locates the point (3') the final
location of joint (3). The length of 2'-3'
equals 2-3. In the triangle 3-3'-3", the side
3' -3" _=...;r;t;._ The relative values of 0 which
are measured by ~/L for each member can now be
calcUlated.

SUbstitution in Slope Deflection Equations: 

We know that 8~ = 8 6 = 0, due to fixity
at joints (1) and (5). Also 8~ = 0 due to
symmetry or only vertical movement of joint
(3). Furthermore due to symmetry 84 =- 8 2

The joint equilibrium equations at (3) and
(4) will not provide independent equations because in the previous substitutions in the
slope-deflection equations 8~ was made equal to
zero and 84 was equal to - 82 •


Shear Equations: 

Due to symmetry the horizontal reactions
at points (1) and (5) are equal and opposite
and therefore in static balance. Since we have
two unknowns 82 and ¢, we need another equation
to use with equation (i). This equation can be
obtained by stating that the horizontal reaction

H2-~ on member 2-1 at end (2) must be equal and
opposite to H2_~' the horizontal reaction at
end (2) of member 2-3.

A12.9 Comments on Slope-Deflection Method.


The example problems solutions indicate
that the method of slope-deflection has two advantages, namely, (1) it reduces the number of
equations to be solved simultaneously and (2)
it presents equations that are easily and
rapidly formulated.


Thus for structures with a high degree of
redundancy, the slope-deflection method should
be considered as possibly the best method of
solution. The solving of the equations in this
method are readily programmed for solution by
high speed computing machinery.

**BENDING** **STRESSES**



A13.0 Introduction.
The bar AB in Fig. a is subjected to an
axial compressive load P. If the compressive
stresses are such that no buckling of the bar
takes place, then bar sections such as 1-1 and
2-2 move parallel to each other as the bar
shortens under the compressive stress.

applied moment the beam takes the exaggerated
deflected shape as shown.
The applied bending moment vector acts
parallel to the Z axis, or in other words the
applied bending moment acts in a plane perpendicular to the Z axis. Consider a beam segment
of length L. Fig. d shows the distortion of
this segment when plane sections remain plan~
after bending of the beam.
It will be assumed that the beam section is
homogeneous, that is, made of the same material,
and that the beam stresses are below the proportional limit stress of the material or in
other words that Hooke's Law holds.

In Fig. b the same bar is used as a simply
supported beam with two applied loads P as
shown. The shear and bending moment diagrams
for the given beam loading are also shown. The
portion of the beam between sections 1-1 and 2-2
under the given loading are subjected to pure
bending since the shear is zero in this region.
Experimental evidence for a beam segment
Ax taken in this beam region under pure bending
shows that plane sections remain plane after
bending but that the plane sections rotate with
respect to each other as illustrated in Fig. c,
where the dashed line represents the unstressed
beam segment and the heavy section the shape
after pure bending takes place. Thus the top
fibers are shortened and subjected to compressive stresses and the lower fibers are elongated
and subjected to tensile stresses. Therefore at
some plane n-n on the cross-section, the fibers
suffer no deformation and thus have zero stress.
This location of zero stress under pure bending
is referred to as the neutral axis.

zero, hence the term _f_ yda must equal c zero and

A13.2 BEAM BENDING STRESSES



The neutral axis does not pass through the
beam section centroid when the beam is nonhomogeneous that is, the modulus of elasticity is not
constant over the beam section and also when
Hooke's Law does not apply or where the stressstrain relationship is non-linear. These beam
conditions are described later in this Chapter.


A13.2 Equations for Bending stress, Homogeneous Beams,
stresses Below Proportional Limit stress.
In the following derivations, it will be
assumed that the plane of the external loads
contain the flexural axis of the beam and hence,
the beam is not subjected to torsional forces
which, if present, would produce bending stresses if free warping of the beam sections was restrained, as occurs at points of support. The
questions of flexural axes and torsional effects
are taken up in later chapters.


Plane

Thus, Yn = (y - x tan 0) cos 0 - - - 
- y cos 0 - x sin o- - - - - - (2 )


Then Eq. (1) becomes


o = k (y cos o- x sin 0) - - - - - - (3 )


This equation contains three unknowns, 0,
k, and 0. For solution, two additional equations are furnished by conditions of equilibrium namely, that the sum of the moments of the
external forces that lie on one side of the
section ABCD about each of the rectangular axes
X-X and Y-Y must be equal and opposite, respectively, to the sum of the moments of the internal
stresses on the section about the same axes.
Let M represent the bending moment in the
plane of the loads; then the moment about axis
X-X and Y-Y is Mx ~ M cos Q and My = M sin Q.
The moment of the stresses on the beam section
about axis X-X is _/0_ da y. Hence, taking
moments about axis X-X, we obtain for equilibrium,

M cos Q = _/_ 0 da y




_- /_ k (cos 0 y 2 da - sin 0 xyda)

= k cos 0 _/_ y [2] da - k sin 0 _/_ xyda


In similar manner, taking moments about

Fig. A13.1 represents a cross-section of a
straight cantilever beam with a constant crosssection, subjected to external loads which lie
in a plane making an angle Q with axis Y-Y
through the centroid O. To simplify the figure,
the flexural axis has been assumed to coincide
with the centroidal axis, which in general is
not true.
Let NN represent the neutral axis under the
given loading, and let 0 be the angle between
the neutral axis and the axis X-X. The problem
is to find the direction of the neutral axis and
the bending stress 0 at any point on the section.
In the fundamental beam theory, it is assumed that the unit stress varies directly as
the distance from the neutral axis, within the
proportional limit of the material. Thus, Fig.
A13.2 illustrates how the stress varies along a
line such as mm perpendicular to the neutral
axis N-N.
Let 0 represent unit bending stress at any
point a distance Yn from the neutral axis. Then
the stress 0 on da is


(1)


where k is a constant. Since the position of
the neutral axis is unknown, Yn will be expressed for convenience in terms of rectangular coordinates with respect to the axes X-X and Y-Y.



M sin Q = - k sin ¢ _/_ x [2] da + k cos % _/_ xyda(4a)


A13.3 Method 1. stresses for Moments About the
Principal Axes.
In equation (4), the term _/_ y'"da is the
moment of inertia of the cross-sectional area
about axis X-X, which we will denote by Ix, and
the term _/_ xyda represents the product of inertia about axes X-X and Y-Y. We know, however,
that the product of inertia with respect to the
principal axes is zero. Therefore, if we select XX and IT in such a way as to make them
coincide with the principal axes, we can write
equation (4):



M cos Q = k cos 0 Ix
p


In like manner, from equation (4a)



(5)


(6 )



M sin Q



k sin 0 Iy
p



To find the unit stress 0 at any point on the
cross-section, we solve equation (5) for cos 0
and equation (6) for sin 0, and then SUbstituting these values in (3), we obtain the following expressing, giving 0 the subscript b to
represent bending stress: 

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-292-full.png)

M cos Q yp + M sin Q xp
Ixp Iyp


Let the resolved bending moment M cos Q and
M sin Q about the principal axes be given the
symbols Mxp and Myt' Then we can write


(7)


The minus signs have been placed before each
term in order to give a negative value for ab
when we have a positive bending moment, or Mxp
is the moment of a couple acting about xp-x p'
positive when it produces compression in the
upper right hand quadrant. Myp is the moment
about the Yp-Y p axis, and is also positive when
it produces compression in the upper right hand
quadrant.


BENDING STRESS EQUATION FOR SY11METRICAL


BEAM SECTIONS

Since symmetrical axes are principal axes
(term _J_ xyda = 0), the bending stress equation
for bending about the symmetrical XX and YY axes
is obviously,


ab =- MxY _ Myx _ - - (7a)
Ix I
y


A13.4 Method 2. Stresses by use of Neutral Axis for

Given Plane of Loading.
The direction of the neutral axis NN, measured from the XX p principal axis is given by
dividing equation (6) by (5).


Tan _a_ =- Ix tan Q - - - - - (8)
p


N

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-292-0.png)


The negative sign arises from the fact that
Q is measured from one principal axis and 0 is
measured in the same direction from the other
principal axis.
Since equation (8) gives us the location of
the neutral axis for a particular plane of loading,the stress at any point can be found by resolving the external moment into a plane perpendicular to the neutral axis N-N and using the



A13.3


moment of inertia about the neutral axis, hence



ab = [M cos (Q - a)J Yn = MnYn
In r;

In can be determined from the relationship expressed in Chapter A3, namely,


A13.5 Method 3. Stresses from Moments, Section Properties and Distances Referred to any Pair of
Rectangular Axes through the Centroid of the
Section.

The fiber stresses can be found without
resort to principal axes or to the neutral
axis.


Equation (4) can be written:



Mx = k cos 0 Ix - k sin 0 Ixy



(ll)



**where Ix** **=** _**I**_ **y** **2** **da** **and** **Ixy** **=** _**I**_ **xyda,** **and** **Mx** **=**
M cos Q.

In like manner,


My =- k sin 0 Iy + k cos 0 I XY - - - - - (12)


Solving equations (11) and (12) for sin 0 and
cos 0 and substituting their values in equation
(3), we obtain the following expression for the
fiber stress _ab:_ _-_


ab =_ (MyI X - MxI xy ) x _ (MxI y - MyIXY)Y _ (13)
IXIy - I~y IxI y - I~y


For simplification, let


K~ = Ixy/(IxI y - I 2 XY [)]


K 2 = Iy/(IXI y - I\y)


K 3 = Ix/(IXI y - I [2] xy )


SUbstituting these values in Equation (13): 

ab =- (K 3 My - K~Mx) x - (K 2 Mx - K~My)Y - (14)


In Method 2, equation (8) was used to find
the position of the neutral axis for a given
plane of loading. The location of the neutral
axis can also be found relative to any pair of
rectangular centroidal axes X and Y as follows: Since the stress at any point on the neutral
axis must be zero, we can write from equation
(14) that: 

(K 3 My - K~Mx)x =- (K 2 Mx - K 2 My )Y for all
points located on the neutral axis. From Fig.
A13.1 tan 0 = ~ x,


Thus tan 0 =_ (K [3] M [y ] - K~Mx) - - - - - - - (15)
(K~x       - K~My)


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-293-full.png)

A13.4 BEAM BENDING STRESSES



It frequently happens that the plane of the
bending moment coincides with either the X-X or
the Y-Y axis, thus making either Mx or My equal
to zero. In this case, equation (15) can be
simplified. For example, if My = 0

bending. The stresses Fig. A13. 3
will be determined by
each of the three methods as presented in this chapter.



A13.6 Advantages and Disadvantages of the Three

Methods.
Method 2 (bending about the neutral axis
for a given plane of loading) no doubt gives a
better picture of the true action of the beam
relative to its bending as a whole. The point
of maximum fiber stress is easily determined by
placing a scale perpendicular to the neutral
axis and moving it along the neutral axis to
find the point on the beam section farthese away
from the neutral axis. In airplane design,
there are many design conditions, which change
the direction of the plane of loading, thUS,
several neutral axes must be computed for each
beam section, which is a disadvantage as compared to the other two methods.
In determining the shears and moments on
airplane structures, it is common practice to
resolve air and landing forces parallel to the
airplane XYZ axes and these results can be used
directly in method 3, whereas method 1 requires
a further resolution With respect to the principal axes. Methods 1 and 3 are more widely
used than method 2.
Since bending moments about one principal
axis produces no bending about the other principal axis, the principal axes are convenient
axes to use when calculating internal shear flow
distribution.


A13.7 Deflections.

The deflection can be found by using the
beam section properties about the neutral axis
for the given plane of loading and the bending
moment resolved in a plane normal to the neutral
axis. The deflection can also be found by resolving the bending moment into the two principal planes and then using the properties about
the principal axes. The resultant deflection is
the vector sum of the deflections in the direction of the principal planes.

The first step common to all three methods
is the calculation of the moments of inertia
about the centroidal X and Y axes. Table A13.1
gives the detailed calCUlations. The properties are first calculated about the reference
axes x'x' and y'y' and then transferred to the
parallel centroidal axes.

IN = Ix = 81.18.

NOTE: In the three solutions, the distance
from the axis in question to the stringers 1,
9, and 12 have been taken to the centroid of
each stringer unit. ThUS, the stresses obtained are average axial stresses on the
stringers. If the maximum stress is desired,
the arm should refer to the most remote part of
the stringer or the skin surface.


Approximate ..Method.

It is sometimes erroneously assumed that
the external bending moments Mx and My produce
bending about the X and Y axes as though they
were neutral axes. To show the error of this
assumption, the stresses will be computed for
stringers 1 and 9.

This method of solution involves more calculations than that required in sUbstituting in
the bending stress formula, however, the stUdent
should obtain a better understanding of the in


ternal force action from this method of solution. In solving nonhomogeneous beams and
beams stressed above the elastic limit stress,
this method of solution often proves necessary
or advantageous because no simple beam bending
stress formula can be derived.
In Fig. A13.12, let 0b be the intensity on
the most remote fiber, or 3.09" above the neutral axis. Table A shows the calculations of
the total stress on each of the portions of the
cross-section and their moment about the neutral
axis, all in terms of the unknown stress, 0b'

Then, the average stress = 2 0b =

neutral axis to the centroid of the load on
each of the blocks. For portion (1) the stress
pattern is triangular, and y = 2/3 x 2.09 =
1.39". On portions (2), (3), (5) and (6) the
bending stress distribution is trapezoidal, and
the arm is to the centroid of this trapezoid.
The total internal resisting moment of

_A13.9_ Bending Stresses in Beams with Non-Homogeneous
Sections, Stresses within the Elastic Ranges.

In general, beams are usually made of one
material, but special cases often arise where
two different materials are used to form a beam
section. For example, a commerical airplane in
its lifetime often undergoes a number of changes
or modifications such as the addition of additional installations, fixed equipment, larger
engines, etc. This increase in airplane weight
increases the structural stresses and it often
becomes necessary to strengthen various structural members at the critical stress points.
Since space limitations are usually critical, it
often necessitates that the reinforcing material
be stiffer than the original material. Years
ago, when spruce wood was a common material for
wing beams, it was normal practice to use reinforcements at critical stress points of stiffer
wood material such as maple in order to cut down
the size of the reinforcements. In aluminum
alloy beams, the use of heat-treated alloy steel
reinforcements are often used because steel is
29000,000/10500,000 or 2.76 times stiffer than
aluminum alloy.


SOLUTION BY MEANS OF TRANSFORMED


BEA1'1 SECTION.


To illustrate how the stresses in a composite beam can be determined, two example problems will be presented.


Example Problem 5.
Fig. A13.14 shows the original beam section
which is entirely spruce wood. Fig. A13.15
shows the reinforced or modified beam section.
Two ears of maple wood have been added to the
upper part as shown and a steel strap has been
added to the bottom face of the beam. The problem is to find the stress at the top and bottom
points on the beam section when the beam section
is SUbjected to an external bending moment of
60000 in. Ibs. about a horizontal axis which
causes compression in the upper beam portion.
The modulus of elasticity (E) for the 3 differ


ent materials is: 

Espruce [=] 1,300,000 psi.


= 1,600,000 psi.
Emaple


Esteel = 29,000,000 psi.


SOLUTION:


The first step in the solution is to
transform the reinforced beam section of Fig.
A13.15 into an eqUivalent beam section composed
of the same material throughout. This is possible, because the modulus of elasticity of each
material gives us the measure of stiffness for
that material. In this solution the reinforced
beam will be transformed into a spruce beam
section as illustrated in Fig. AI3.16.


Emaple ~~=~~ 1,600,000 =1.23
Espruce 1,300,000


Esteel ~~=~~ 29,000,000 = 22.3
Espruce ~~1,300,000~~


Thus to transform the maple reinforcing strips
in Fig. A13.15 into spruce we increase the
width of each strip to 1.23 x 0.5 = 0.615 inches
as shown in Fig. AI3.16. Likewise, to transform the steel reinforcing strip into spruce, we
make the width equal to 22.3 x 1.5 = 33.4 inches
as shown in Fig. A13.16.
This transformed equivalent section is now
handled like any homogeneous beam section Which
is stressed within the elastic limit of the
materials. The usual calculation would locate
the neutral axis as shown and the moment of inertia of the transformed section about the
neutral axis would give a value of 51.30 in .•


Bending stress at upper edge of beam section: 

         - 60000 x 3.33
--=-=--==-- = - 3900 psi.
51.30


Referring to Fig. A13.15, this stress would be


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-301-full.png)

A13.12 BEAM BENDING STRESSES



the stress in the spruce section. Since the reinforcing strips are maple, the stress at the
top edge of these maple strips would be 1.23
times (- 3900) =- 4880 psi.
The bending stress at the lower edge of the
transformed beam section of Fig. A13.16 would be:


=_ 60000 x (- 2.73) = 3200 i
°bt 51. 30 ps .


The stress in the steel reinforcing strap
thus equals 22.3 times 3200 = 71500 psi.
Since all these stresses are below the
elastic limit stress for the 3 materials the
beam bending stress formula as used is
applicable.


Example Problem 6.
Fig. A13.17 shows an unsymmetrical beam
section composed of four stringers, a,b,c and
d of equal area each and connected by a thin
web. The web will be neglected in this example
problem. Each of the stringers is made from
different material as indicated on Fig. A13.17.
The beam section is subjected to the bending
moment Mx and My as indicated. Let it be required to determine the stress and total load on
each stringer in resisting these applied external bending moments.

Since the stress-strain diagram in tension
is different from that in compression (See Fig.
A13.19) the neutral axis will not coincide with
the centroidal axis of the round bar regardless
of the fact that it is a symmetrical shape.
Thus the method of solution is a trial and error
one since the location of the neutral axis can
not be solved for directly. In Fig. b of Fig.
A13.20 the neutral axis has been assumed 0.0375
inches above the centerline axis of the bar. It
was assumed toward the tension side because observation of the stress-strain curve of Fig.



A13.19 shows that for a given strain in the inelastic range the resulting tensile stress is
higher than the resulting compressive stress,
and furthermore from internal equilibrium the
total tensile stress on the cross-section must
equal the total compressive stress.
The problem as stated assumed that a
compressive unit strain of 0.01 caused failure.
Fig. b thus shows the strain picture on the
beam just before failure since plane sections
remain plane after bending in the inelastic
range. Table A13.2 gives the detailed calculations for determining the internal resisting
moment developed under the given strain condition.


TABLE A13.2


The summation of column (6) shculd be
zero. Since the discrepancy is 740 Ibs., it
means that the assumed position for the neutral
axis is a little too high, however the discrepancy is negligible. The total internal
resisting moment is 56735 in. Ibs. (Col. 7).
If we take a maximum unit compressive
strain of 0.01 we find the corresponding stress
from Fig.A13.19 to be 48500 psi. If this
stress is used as the failing stress in the

beam formula M = ~ we obtain,
c


M = 48500 x 0.785 = 38000 in. Ibs.

(0.785 = ~ of round bar = nr [3] /4)


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-304-full.png)

Thus using the same failing stress at the
far extreme fiber the beam formula based on
linear stress-strain relationship gives an ultimate bending strength of 38000 as compared to
a true strength of 56735 or only 67 percent as
much.
Fig. c of Fig. A13.10 shows the true stress
distribution on the cross-section, which explains why the resisting moment is higher than
when a triangular distribution is used.
The problem of the ultimate bending
strength of structural shapes is discussed in
detail in Volume II.


A13.11 Curved Beams. Stresses Within the Elastic

Range.
The equations derived in the previous articles of this chapter were for beams that were
straight. Thus in Fig. A13.21, the element of
length (L) used in the derivation was constant
over the depth of the beam. The strain (6L/L)
was therefore directly proportional to 6L which
had a linear variation.
In a curved beam, the assumption that plane
sections remain plane after bending still
applies, however the beam segment of a curved
beam cannot have equal width over the depth of
the beam because of the curvature as illustrated
in Fig. A13.22, or in other words the length of
the segment is greater on the outside edge (L )
than on the inside edge (Li). Thus in calcu

Stress
Fig. A13. 22 Distribution


lating the strain distribution over the beam
depth the change in length 6L at a point must be
divided by the segment width at that point.
Thus even though plane sections remain plane
the strain distribution over the section will
not be linear. The width of the segment at any
point is directly proportional to the radius of
curvature of the segment and thus the strain at
a point on the segment is inversely to the
radius of curvature. This gives a hyperbolic
type of strain distribution as illustrated in
Fig. A13.22, and if the strains are within the
elastic limit the stress distribution will be
similar. The development of a beam formula
based on a hyperbolic stress distribution is



A13.l5


given in most books on advanced engineering
mechanics and will not be repeated here.
It is convenient however to express the
influence of the beam curvature in the form of
a correction factor K by which the stresses obtained by the beam formula for straight beams
can be multiplied to obtain the true stresses
for the curved beams. Thus for a curved beam
the maximum stress can be calculated from the
equation


cr = K ~ - - - - - (19)
I


Table A13.3 gives the value of K for
various beam section shapes and beam radius of
curvatures. The table shows that for only
rather sharp curvatures is the correction appreciable. In general for airplane fuselage
rings on frames the curvature influence can be
neglected. However there are often fittings
and mechanical structural units in airplane
construction whose parts involve enough curvature to make the influence on the stress of
primary importance. The concentration of
stress on the insirle edge of a curved unit in
bending may influence the fatigue strength of
unit considerably, thus a consideration of the
possible influence of curvature should be a
regular part of design procedure.
In the inelastic or plastic stress range,
the influence of beam curvature should be
considerably less since the stiffness of a
material in the inelastic range is much less
than in the elastic stress range and changes
rather slowly as the stress increases.


A13.l2 Problems.


(1) Fig. A13.23 shows the cross-section of a
single cell beam with 12 stringers.
Assume the walls and webs are ineffective
in bending. Calculate load in each
stringer by use of beam formula. Also
calculate stringer loads by equating internal resisting moment to external bending moment. Each stringer area is same
and equals 0.1 sq. in. applied bending
moment Mx =- 100,000 in. lb.

**CHAPTER** A 14

**BENDING** **SHEAR STRESSES· SOLID** **AND** **OPEN SECTIONS**

**SHEAR CENTER**



A14.1 Introduction.

In Chapter A6, the shear stresses in a
member subjected to pure torsional forces were
considered in detail. In Chapter A13, the subject of bending stresses in a beam subjected to
pure bending was considered in considerable detail. In practical structures however, it
seldom happens that pure bending forces (couples) are the loading forces on the beam. The
usual case is that bending moments on a beam
are due to a transfer of external shear forces.
Thus bending of a beam usually involves both
bending (longitudinal tension and compression
stresses) and shear stresses.
The same assumptions that were made in
Chapter A13 in deriving the bending stress
equations are likewise used in deriving the
equations for flexural shear stresses. With
flexural shear stresses existing, the assumption
that plane sections remain plane after bending
is not completely true, since the shearing
strains cause the beam sections to slightly
warp out of their plane when the beam bends.
This warping action is usually referred to by
the term "shear lag". However, except in cases
of beams with wide thin flanges, the error introduced by neglecting shearing strains is quite
small ffild therefore neglected in deriving the
basic flexural shear stress formula. The problem of shear lag influence is considered in
other C'hapters.


A14.2 Shear Center.
When a beam bends without twisting, due to
some external load system, shearing stresses are
set up on the cross sections of the beam. The
centroid of this internal shear force system is
often referred to as the shear center for the
particular section. The resultant external
shear load at this section must pass through
the shear center of the section if twist of the
section is to be prevented. Thus, if the shear
center is known, it is possible to represent the
external load influences by two systems, one
that causes flexure and the other which causes
only twist.


AB.3 Derivation of Formula for Flexural Shear Stress.

Fig. A14.1 shows a loaded simply supported
beam. When the beam bends downward due to the
given loading, the beam portion above the neutral axis is placed in compression and that below the neutral axis in tension. Consider a
short portion dx of the beam at points DF on the
beam and treat it as a free body as shown in
Fig. A14.3. The variation of tensile and compressive stress on each face of the beam portion

is as indicated. The stress at 1s greater than
_at_ because the bending moment due to the given
beam loading is greater at beam section DD' than
at FF'. Now consider that this beam portion dx
is further cut as indicated by the notch DCEF in
Fig. A14.1, and this segment is shown in Fig.
A14.4 as a free body with the forces as indicated.
Let at = maximum tensile stress at a distance
c from the neutral axis,
Then the stress at a distance y from neutral
axis is ay = at y/c.
The total load on an element of area dA of
the beam cross-section (see Fig. A14.2) thus
equals at _J_ y dA .
c
Now, referring to Fig. A14.4, the total
tensile load on each face of this segment will be
calculated.



Total load on face CD = act _IC_ y dA

From Chapter A13, the equation for flexural
stress _a_ was derived, namely at = Mc/I. Let M
equal the bending moment at beam section DD' and
M' that at beam section FF' and let I and l'the
moment of the inertia of the cross-sectional area
about the neutral axis at these same beam sections
respectively. Then SUbstituting value of at in
equations (1) and (2) we can write,

This shearing stress is at a section just
adjacent to portion (2). If it was taken just
adjacent to portion (1), then the width b in the
equation would be 3 inches instead of 0.5 inch
and the shearing stress would be 0.5/3 times that
shown above, or in other words the shearing
stress changes abruptly when the shear area
changes abruptly.

The shearing stresses as calculated act in the
plane of the beam cross-section in the Y direction and also with the same intensity parallel
to the Z axis which is normal to the beam
section.


Example Problem 2. VARIABLE MOMENT OF INERTIA.
Fig. A14.6 shows a cantilever beam loaded
with a single load of 600 lb. at the end and
acting through the centroid of the beam crosssection. The beam section is constant between
stations 0 and 132, then it tapers uniformly to
the sections shown for stations 175 and 218.
The shear stress distribution on the beam crosssection at stations 175 and 218 will be determined.

From the results in Table A14.1, it should be
noticed that the change in moment of inertia between the three stations is directly porportional
to the change in bending moment, hence the same
value for the bending stresses for all three stations. Columns 6, 7 and 8 give the total bending
stress load on portions A, Band C of the three
cross-sections (see Fig. A14.6). These values
equal the average stress on the portions times
the area of the portion; for example, for station
132, the load on portion A:


load = 8180 + 6135 x 1 x 1 7157 #, and for
2

portion C:


load = 40902 + 0 x 2 x .25   - 1023#

A14.5 Maximum Shear Stresses for Simple Cross-Sections.
Table A14.2 gives the value of the maximum
shear stress on a few simple sections and where
it occurs on the cross section, (e is distance
from neutral axis to point of maximum shear
stress). V equals the shear load normal to the
neutral axis and it acts along the centerline
axis, thus no twisting on the section. A is the
total cross-sectional area. The maximum shear
stress is given in terms of the average shear
stress which equals _VIA._


A14.6 Derivation of Flexural Shear Flow Equation.
Symmetrical Beam Section.
To emphasize further the fundamental relationships, a second derivation of the equation
for shear stress distribution will be presented.
Fig. A14.14 shows a portion of a cantilever beam
carrying a load P at the free end as shown.
This load is so located as to cause the beam to
bend in the YZ plane without twist about a Y
axis. The problem is to derive relationships
which will give the magnitude and sense of the
shear flow distribution on the cross-section of
the beam.
Fig. A14.15 shows a free body of a small
portion of the beam cut out from the upper
flange of the beam at points (a b) in Fig.
AI4.14. Under the given external load P it is
obvious that the upper half of the beam is subjected to compressive stresses. In Fig. AI4.15,
C y is larger than C y since the cantilever bending moment is greater at station Y' .

Fig. A14.14 Fig. A14.16 Fig.A14.15


The free edge of beam flange forms the
right side face of the element in Fig. A14.15
and thus the shear flow force on this face is
zero as indicated. The shear flow forces on the
internal or cut faces in lbs. per inch are qy
and qx as indicated. Since the sense of these
shear forces is unknown, they will be assumed as
acting in the positive direction. (See Fig.
A14.16 for positive sense of forces acting parallel to each of the coordinate axes XYZ.
Now consider the equilibrium of forces in
the Y direction for the element in Fig. A14.15

Equation (7) gives the change in shear flow force
qy between points (a) and (b) and since in figure
A14.15 the value of qy at (a) is zero because of
a free surface, the value of qYb in equation (7)

is the true shear flow force in lbs. per inch at
point (b). The student should realize that
equation (7) gives the shear flow q in the Y direction. The minus sign in equation (7) means
that the positive sense as assumed by the arrowhead on qYb in Fig. A14.15 is incorrect or should


be reversed.
The initial problem was to determine the
shear flow force system in the plane of the beam
cross-section or the ZX plane. From elementary
engineering mechanics, we know that if a shearing
stress occurs on one plane at a point in a body,
a shearing stress of the same intensity exists on
planes at risht angles t a the first plane, or in
general at a point,
qy = qx = qz - - - - - - - - - - - (8)
Before the shear flow in other planes is
completely defined its sense (positive or negative) must be known. Equation (7) gives the magnitude and sense for qy at any desired point on

the cross-section. The question of the sense of
the associated qx and qz is easily determined from
an observation involving eqUilibrium of moments.
This fact will be explained by referring to a
number of free body diagrams.

Fiv. A14.17 shows a free body of a small
element"cut from the beam in Fig. A14.14 at point
(a) on the cross-section. The forces on this
free body are the compressive forces c [P] and C on
the front and rear faces and the shear forces on
the various faces as indicated. The right side
face of the element is a free surface and thus q
on this face is zero.
The shear flow qy on the left side face is
calculated from equation (7) namely

V
qy =- ~ L: Z A         Ix

T' Fig.A14.19

Fig.A14.20



For the given beam loading in Fig. A14.l4 the
load P is up, therefore Vz has a positive sign.
For any portion of area (A) of the cross-section
the distance z in the above equation is therefore positive. Therefore in sUbstituting in the
above equation qy comes out negative for any
point above neutral axis, and likewise for any
point on beam section below the neutral axis the
distance z would have a negative sign and qy
would come out positive. Therefore the sense of
the calculated shear flow qy on the left side of
the element in Fig. A14.l7 is negative or as
indicated by the arrow on the force vector. Now
to find the sense of the shear flow qx on the
front face take moments about a Z axis acting in
the plane of the rear face and through point (0)
which is on the line of action of the forces C'
and C. Only two forces have moments, namely the
side shear force qy dy and the front face shear
force (qx/2)dX. It is obvious by observation
that qx on front face must act to the left as
shown if the moment is to equal zero. The total
shear force on front face is (qx/2)dx because
shear flow at right edge is zero and it varies
linearly to qx at left edge of front face.
Figs. A14.l8, 19 and 20 show free bodies of
elements taken at the other three corners of the
beam section which are labeled c, d, e in Fig.
A14.l4. For all free surfaces q is zero. The
sense of qy as before is given by the equation
as explained before, hence qy is negative in
Fig. A14.l8 and pOSitive in figures 19 and 20.
A simple consideration of moment eqUilibrium as
explained for Fig. A14.l7 gives the sense of the
shear flow Qx as shown in the 3 figures.
Fig. A14.2l shows a free body of the entire
upper beam flange and a short portion of the
beam web. qy from the equation is negative and
this acts as shown in the figure. Now if we
take moments about a X axis in the plane of the



back side and through a point on the line of
action of C' and C, the shear flow qz on the
front face must act downward in order to balance
the moment due to qy.
Fig. A14.22 shows the results for a free
body of the lower flange plus a small web portion. qy is positive from equation and thus qz
must be downward for moment equilibrium.
From the results obtained for these 6 different locations, a simple rule can be stated
relative to sense of shear flows in the plane of
the cross-section, namely: If the calculated shear flow is directed toward the
boundary line between the two intersecting planes of the particular free body, then the shear flow on the other plane is
also directed toward the common boundary line, and conversely directed away if the calculated shear flow is directed

away.


Fig. A14.l4 shows the sense of the shear
flow pattern on the beam section as determined
for the given external loading.


A14.7 Shear Stresses and Shear Center for Beam Sections
with One Axis of Symmetry.


Example Problem. CHANNEL SECTION.
Fig. A14.23 shows a cantilever beam With
channel shaped cross-section carrying a 100 lb.
downward load as shown. The problem is to determine the lateral position of this load so that
the beam will bend without tWist. This position
will coincide with the lateral pOSition of the
centroid of the shear flow system on the beam
cross-section'which holds the external load in
equilibrium without twisting of the beam section.
The cantilever beam has been cut at a section
abc d (Fig. A14.23) Which is far enough from the
fixed end of the beam (not shown) so that the
effects of beam end restraint against section
warping can be neglected. In Fig. A14.23, the
internal forces holding the beam in eqUilibrium
are sketched in. They consist of a longitudinal
stress system of tension and compression and
variable shear flow system in the plane of the
cross-section. In this problem we are only considered with the internal resisting shear flow
system.
For solution of this problem the moment of
inertia Ix must be known. If calculated it
would be Ix = 0.2667 in [4 ] 

SOLUTION: - From equation (7)


qy = - ~~ ~ z A - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - (8)


we know that the shear stress is zero at a free
edge, thus the solution of equation (8) is
started at either points (a) or (d).
The shear Vz is    - 100 lb. Thus equation
(8) for our problem reduces to,


    - 100

We will start at point (a) in solving equation (9) and proceed around the section.

Point (b) z = - 1, A = area between (a) and (b).

boundary line as shown in Fig. A14.24.
Common sense tells us that the resisting
shear flow qz on the channel web must be directed
upward because it is the only force system that
can balance the 100 lb. load as far as ~Fz = 0

is concerned.
In general the shear flow is continuous
around the section and only reverses when it
passes through zero which only happens in closed
tubular sections. In general, it is possible in
most cases by observation only, to determine the
sense of the shear flow at some one point on the
beam cross-section. The shear flow being like a
flow of liquid will continue in the same general
direction along the center line of the parts that
make up the beam section.
The small arrows on the beam section of
Fig. A14.23 show the sense of the shear flow
pattern over the beam section. In Fig. A14.25,
the shear flow values as calculated at the various points are plotted to form a shear flow
diagram for the beam section. Between points a
and b or d and c, the arm z in equation (9) is
constant and thus q varies linearly as plotted.
Between b and 0 or a and c the arm z changes and
the area is also a function of z, thus q varies
as z" or parabolic as plotted.
The initial problem was to locate the
centroid of this final shear flow system which
is generally referred to as the shear center.
In Fig. A14.25, Qab, QbC and Qcd represent the
resultant of the shear flow force system on
these three portions of the beam cross-section.
Each force is equal in magnitude to the area of
the shear flow diagram for the particular beam
section portion. Hence,


Qab = [1 x] [ 37.5/2] [ =] [18.75] [ lb.]


Qbc = [2 x] [ 37.5+] [ (56.3-37.5)] [ x2] [ x] [ 2/] 3 [= 100] [ lb.]


Qcd [= 1 x] [ 37.5/2] [ =] [ 18.75] [ lb.]


The resultant R of these three shear forces
will now be determined.



q = 0 + 375 (- 1)(1 x 0.1)

Point (d).



~ Fz = 100 lb.,
qy =-37.5+375 (1) (1 x 0.1) = 0 (free surface)
d Hence



~ Fx = 18.75 - 18.75 = a



We know that the intensity of shear flow in the
ZX plane at any point equals that in the Y direction at the same point. Thus qx or qz equal
the qy values above. The sense of the qx and qz
shear flows must be known before they are completely defined or known. Fig. A14.24 shows a
free body of a small element at point (a) on the
end of the lower beam flange. For any point below the X centroidal axis equation (9) will give
a minus sign for qy. Thus in Fig. A14.24 qy
acts as shown, or directed toward the boundary
line between the side face and the front face.
Then by the simple rule as given in the previous
article qx is also directed toward this common



R = (~ Fz" + h Fx "J1/2 = (lOa" + 0)1/" = 100 lb.


The moment of the resultant about any point such
as (b) in Fig. A14.17 must equal the moment of
the shear flow force system about point (b).
Let e be distance from point b to line of action
of the resultant R.


Hence R e = h M b (of shear flow system) or


100 e = 18.75 x 2 or e 0.375 inches.


Thus the centroid of the internal shear resisting force system lies on a vertical line

A14.8 BENDING SHEAR STRESSES. SOUND AND OPEN SECTIONS. SHEAR CENTER.



0.375 inches to left of point b as shown in Fig.
A14.23. For bending about the centroidal Z axis
without tWist the resultant of the internal
shear flow system would obviously, due to symmetry of section about X centroidal axis, lie on
the X axis, hence shear center for the given
channel section is at point 0 in Fig. A14.23.
The external load of 100 lb. would have to be
located 0.375 inches to the left of the centerline of the channel web if bending of the
channel without twist is to occur.


A14.8 Shear Stresses for Unsymmetrical Beam Sections.
In chapter A13, which dealt with bending
stresses in beams, three methods were presented
for determining the bending stresses in beams
with unsymmetrical beam sections. The bending
stress equations for these three methods will be
repeated here: 

Method 1. The Principal Axis Method.



Method 3. The k Method.

Fig. A14.26 shows a Zee Section subjected
to a 10,000 lb. shear load acting through the
shear center of the section and in the direction
as shown. The problem will be to calculate the
shear flow qy at two points on the beam section,
namely points b and c as indicated on the figure.
The shear flow at these two places will be calCUlated by all 3 methods.

beam section properties and since the direction

Fig. A14.27 shows the position of the

at the free edge of the upper portion (1) is
zero. For the shear flow at point (b), the
area to be used in the summations Z zpA and
.z xpA is the area of element (1). The arms zp
and xp can be calculated by simple trigonometry.
Fig. A14.27 shows the value of these distances,
namely xp =- 0.1184 and zp = 1.5136.

SOLUTION BY METHOD 3 - (The k Method).

In this method, only the section properties
about the centroidal X and Z axes are needed.
These properties as previously calculated in
Table A14.3 are,



Ix = 0.6035, Iz = 0.0574,

For portion (1), x =- 0.45 in., z = 1.45 in.

General Comments.
The author prefers solution method number 3
since it avoids the calculation of additional
angles and section properties as required in
methods 1 and 2. Furthermore, in calculating the
shears and moments on the airplane wing, fuselage and other major sturctural units it is convenient to refer these shears and moments to the
conventional X Y Z axes, and thus these values
can be used in method 3 without further resolution. From an investigation of many airplane
stress analysis reports, it appears that the engineers of most airplane companies prefer to use
method 3.


A14.9 Beams with Constant Shear Flow Webs.

Fig. A14.29 shows a Z
beam composed of heavy
kfj
flange members and a curved ~r""e 111'r
thin web. For bending
about the X-X axis, the

side of the beam absorbs \ I ~
very little compressive ~ I
stress, since buckling of ~
the web will take place 'Flange
under low stresses, par- Z Fig. A14.29
ticularly when the curvature of the web is
small. On the tension side, the web will be
more effective, but if the flange areas are
relatively large, the proportion of the total
bending tensile stress carried by the web is
small as compared to that carried by the tension
flange. Thus for beams composed of individual
flange members connected by thin webs it is
often assumed that the flanges develop the entire longitudinal bending resistance which
therefore means that the shear flow is constant

Resolving the external shear load of
10,000 into x and z components, we obtain,


Vx = 10000 sin 30° = 5000 lb.


Vz = 10000 cos 30° = 8667 lb.


SUbstituting values of Vx ' Vz and k values in
equation (16) we obtain 

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-318-full.png)

over a particular web. In other words in the
shear flow equation q = V [z] _I_ z d A, if the area
Ix
of the web is neglected then q is constant between flange members.


RESULTANr OF CONSTANr SHEAR FLOW FORCE SYSTEMS


Fig. A14.29 shows a beam assumed to be
carrying a downward shear load (not shown) and
to cause bending about axis x-x Without tWist.
Assuming the two flanges develop the entire
bending resistance, the shear flow q is constant on the web and acts upward along the web
to balance the assumed external downward load.
The resultant of this resisting shear flow
force system will give the lateral position of
the shear center for this beam section. The
problem then is to find the resultant of the
shear flow system.

Let q = load per inch along web (constant).


Let R = resultant of the q force system.


From elementary mechancis,


R = _J_ z q~ + Z q~,where qx and qy are the x
and y components of the q forces along the web.
Since q is constant, Z qx is zero, hence,


(17)


Equation (17) states that the magnitUde of
the resultant of a constant flow force system
is equal to the shear flow q times the straight
line distance between the two ends of the shear
flow system.
Since Z qx is zero, the direction of the
resultant is parallel to the straight line
joining the ends of the web.
The location of the resultant force is
found by using the principle of moments, namely,
that the moment of the resultant about any
point must equal the moment of the original
force system about the same point. In Fig.
A14.29 assume point (0) as a moment center.
Then R e = q L r
but R = q h


hence e = q ----q1l - L r _ tl L r (18)


In equation (18) the term L r is equal to
twice the area (A), where area (A) is the enclosed area formed by drawing straight lines
from moment center (0) to the ends of the shear
flow force system. Thus


2 A
e = ~    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - (19)


The shear center thus lies at a distance e
to the left of point (0), and the external shear

load would have to act through this point if
tWisting were to be eliminated.

sheet to form the webs and walls. The flange
members are numbered a to h and the areas of
each are given on the figure. It will be assumed that the webs and walls develop no bending
resistance and thus the shear flow between adjacent flange members will be constant. The
problem is to determine the shear center for the
beam section.


SOLUTION: 


The first letter of the subscript refers
to the flange member where the shear flow q is
being calculated and the second letter indicates
on which adjacent side of the particular flange
member. Hence qab means the shear flow at
flange (a) but on the side toward (b).


qab = qba = - 1.25 (Since no additional flange
area is added, and thus
shear flow is constant on

Since the beam section is symmetrical
about the X axis, the centroidal X and Z axes
are also principal axes, since the product of
inertia Ixz is zero.
The vertical position of the beam section
centroid due to symmetry is midway between the
upper and lower flanges.
To find the horizontal position of the
centroid, take moments of the flange areas
about the left end or line bc:



moments of the flange areas qbc = qba - 2.5 Zb z A
end or line bc: - - 1.25 - 2.5 x 5 x 0.4 = - 6.25 Ib./in.

qcb - 2.5 Zc z A

=- 6.25 - 2.5 x (- 5 x 0.4) =

The moments of inertia for the section about
the centroidal x and y axes are:

4.375 + 0.4 x 9.375 [8] = 64.4 in [4 ]     

HORIZONTAL POOr-PION OF SHEAR CENTER: 

The horizontal position of the shear center
will coincide with the centroid of the shear
flow system due to bending about axis xx without twist. For simplicity, to eliminate large
decimal values for shear flow values an external upward shear load Vz = 100 lb. will be
assumed and the internal resisting shear flow
system will be calculated for this external
loading.
From equation (8)

qy = - 40 Z z A =- 2.5 Z z A


We could start the solution at either of
two points (a) or h since these points are free
edges and thus qy is zero. In this solution,
we will start at the free edge at point (a) and
go counterclockwise around the beam section.
The area of each flange member has been concen
trated at a point coinciding with the centroid
of each flange area. In solving for the q values the subscript y will be omitted, and subscripts using the flange letters will be used

The sign or sense of each shear flow is for
the shear flow in the y direction as explained
in the derivations of the shear flow equations.
The procedure now is to determine the sense of
the shear flow in the plane of the cross-section
or in the xz plane. It is only necessary to
determine this sense at the beginning point, that
is in sheet panel abo The surest way to determine this sense is to draw a simple free body
sketch of flange member (a) as illustrated in
Fig. A14.31. The shear flow on the cut face is
qy(ab) =- 1.25 and
this value is shown
on the free body. By ""''''--~ --f- [q] (ab)

section is also directed toward the common
boundary line and thus qx(ab) has a sense as
shown in Fig. A14.31. The sense of the shear
flow on the cross-section will now continue in
this direction until the sign changes in the
origional calculation, which means therefore the
shear flow sense will reverse. Fig. A14.32
shows a plot of the shear flow pattern with the
sense indicated by the arrow heads.

Z Fx =- 5 x 1.25 + 5 x 1.25 - 5 x 1.25 + 5 x


1.25 = 0 (check).


The shear flow force system in Fig. A14.32
causes the section to bend about axis xx without tWist. The resultant of this system is 100
lb. acting down in the z direction. The position of this resultant will thus locate the
lateral position of the shear center.
Equating the moments of the shear flow
system about some point such as (c) to the moment of the resultant about the same point we
obtain: 

100 e = 10 x 3.75 x 15 - 1.25 x 0.5 x 2 x 5 
1.25 x 0.5 x 2 x 10 + 1.25 x 0.5 x 2 x 15

qgh 3.589 - 1.55 x 9.375 x 0.2 = 0.674


Fig. A14.33 shows the plotted shear flow
results. The signs of the calculated shear
flows are for shear flows in the y direction.
Simple consideration of a free body of flange
member (a) will give the sign or sense of the
shear flow in the plane of the beam section.
Thus in Fig. A14.34 qx must act as shown when
qy is positive.

A14.11 Shear Center Location By Using Neutral Axis
Method.


In a beam subjected to bending there is a
definite neutral axis position for each different external plane of loading on the beam. The
shear flow equation with respect to the neutral
axis is,

= Distance to neutral axis



In finding the shear center location of an
unsymmetrical section, it is convenient to assume that the Z and X axes are neutral axis and
find the shear flow system for bending about
each axis by equation (20). The resultant of
each of these shear flow force systems will pass
through the shear center, thus the intersection
of these two resultant forces will locate the
shear center.


Example Problem


The same beam section as used in the
previous article (see Fig. A14.36) will be used
to illustrate the neutral axis method.

The resultant of the internal resisting
shear flow system equals V 100 [2] + 100 [2] = 141.14
lb.

To locate this resultant we use the principle of moments. Taking point (b) as a moment
center,


141.14 e = 8 x 5.68 x 16 - 4.544 x 36 n


212
hence e = 141.14 = 1.50 inch.


Therefore external load must act at a distance
e = 1.50" from (b) as shown in Fig. A14.37. The
load so located will pass thru shear center of
section. To obtain the shear center location,
another loading on the beam can be assumed, and
where the line of action of the resultant of the
resisting shear flow system intersects the resUltant as found above would locate the shear
center as a single point. If the shear center
location is desired it is convenient to assume
a unit Vz and Vx acting separately and find the
horizontal and vertical locations of the shear
center from the 2 separate shear flow force
systems.

plane of loading as yet unknown. We will further
assume that when this unknown external loading
is resolved normal to the X neutral axis, that
it will give a value of 100 lb., or Vz = 100.
From the previous article Ix = 90.667.

CHAPTER A 15

**SHEAR FLOW** **IN** **CLOSED** **THIN** - **WALLED SECTIONS**



A1S. 1 Introduction. The wing, fuselage and empennage structure of modern aircraft is essentially a single or multiple cellular beam with
thin webs and walls. The design of such
structures involves the consideration of the
distribution of the internal resisting shear
stresses. This chapter introduces the student
to the general problems of shear flow distribution. Chapter A14 should be covered before
taking up this chapter.


A1S.2 Single Cell Beam. Symmetrical About One Axis.
All Material Effective in Resisting Bending
Stresses.

Fig. A15.1 shows a single cell rectangular
beam carrying the· load of 100 lb. as shown.
The problem is to find the internal resisting
shear flow pattern at section abed.


100#



open sections we could start the summation at a
free surface where q would be zero, thus the
summation to any other point would give the true
shear flow qy. In a closed cell there is no
free end, therefore the value of qy is unknown
for any point.


Equation (1) gives the shear distribution
for bending about the X axis without tWist.
The general procedure is to assume a value of
the shear flow qy at some point and then find
the shear flow pattern for bending without
tWist under the given external load. The centroid of this internal shear flow system will
be the location where the external shear load
should act for bending without twist. Since
the given external shear would have a moment
about this centroid, this unbalanced moment
must be made zero by adding a constant shear
flow system to the cell.


To illustrate we will assume qy to be zero
at point 0 on the web - ad.


qo = O. The term = 100/62.5 = 1.6

Solution 1


Due to symmetry of material the X centroidal axis lies at the mid-height of the
beam. The shear flow equation requires the
value of Ix, the moment of inertia of the
section about the X axis.


Ix = 1~X.15XIO"+2~OX.05X5lilJ = 62.5 in. [4]


From Chapter A14, the equation for shear
flow is,


qy =- i~ 2: zA - - - - - (1)


This equation gives the change in shear
flow between the limits of the summation. In

qod = -z-1.6 2:~ zA =-2-1.6(-2.5)5xO.l=0


Fig. A15.2 shows a plot of the shear flow
reSUlts. On the vertical web the increase in
shear is parabolic since the area varies
directly with distance z.


The intensity of qx and qz in the plane of
the cross-section is equal to the values of q
found above which are in the y direction. The
sense of qx and qz is determined as explained
in detail in Art. A14.6 of Chapter A14.

-8.34 it/in.

2 it/in.


Fig. A15-2


Fig. A15.2 also shows the resultant shear
flow force on each of the four walls of the
cell. The resultant shear force on each
equals the area of the shear flow diagram on
each position.


For example,


Qab =( 2 ; 10 )20 = 120 lb.


1
Qda =3 x 2 x 10 = 6.67 lb.


Qbc = 10 x 10 + 0.667 x 1 x 10 = 106.7


The internal shear flow force system as
given in Fig. A15.2 will now be checked forw
equilibrium with given external shear loading
of 100 lb. as shown in Fig. A15.1.


~Fz = 100 (external) + 6.67   - 106.67

     - 0 (check)


~Fx = 120 - 120 = 0 (check)


Equilibrium of moments must also be
satisfied. Take moments of all forces about
point d. The external load has no moment
about d.


~~ = 120 x 10 + 106.67 x 20

= 3344 in. lb. clockwise


Thus we have an unbalanced moment which
must be made zero if we are to have equilibrium.


The unbalanced moment of 3334 in. lb.
can be balanced by adding a constant shear
in a counter-clock#ise direction around the
cell. The value of this balancing shear flow
would equal,


      - M - -3334      - 8 34 Ib/'
q - - 2A    - 2 x 200 - - • In.


(A equals area of cell = 10 x 20)



-6.34 it/in.



Fig. A15-3

If this constant shear flow of -8.34 was
not added then the external load of 100 lb.
would have to be re-located so that it passed
through the centroid of the shear flow pattern
in A15.2. To find this centroid location, we
can equate the moment of the internal shear
flow pattern about some point to the moment of
the resultant of the system about the same
point.


Resultant R = Y ~Fx "+ ~Fz 2= V 100" + 0

= 100 acting down.

                    Take moments about point d. Let x equal
distance to resultant.


Hi = m d (internal system)


100 x = 120 x 10 + 106.67 x 20


hence x = 33.33 in. Thus the external load
would have to be moved 33.33 inches to right if
the pattern of A15.2 would hold it in equilibrium.
Since we assume q = zero at point 0, this means
an open cell with the free end at 0 would bend
without tWist if the external load was moved the
distance x. 

The student should work this same problem
by assuming q at some other point is zero instead of point 0 as assumed in the above solution.


Solution No.2. Shear Center Method.


In this SOlution, we determine the centroid
of the internal shear flow system for bending of
the closed section about axis X without twist.
This point is called the shear center. The
external shear load can then be resolved into a
shear force acting through the shear center plus
a torsional moment about the shear center.


We start the solution, exactly as in solution 1, by assuming the shear flow q = 0 at
point O. In a sense we are cutting the cell at
o and making it an open section. The resulting
shear flow is as given in A15.2. This open


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-328-full.png)

section will bend without twist if the external shear load acts through the shear
center of the open section.


The closed section will be assumed to
bend without twist, and the resulting shear
flow pattern will be determined. 6.36 JIlin.


The equation for angular twist g (See
Chapter A6) per inch length of beam is,

_ 1 qL '
g - 2AG Z t where L equals the length


of a web or wall.



or 2Ag = ~ Z i [L ]    - The right hand 3ide of


this equation represents the total shearing
strain around the cell which must be zero for
no twist of cell. Since G is constant, we
can assume it as unity as only relative
values of strain are needed in the solution.
Thus the total shearing strain 6 around cell
is proportional to,


----     -     -     -     -     -     6=Zi [L] (2)


Using the values of q from Fig. A15.2
and substituting in (2),



![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-328-0.png)

Fig. A15-4


The location of the resultant of the shear
flow force system of Fig. A15.4 will locate the
horizontal position of the shear center. Due
to symmetry of the section about the X axis,
the vertical position of the shear center will
be on the X axis, because for bending about the
Z axis, the shear flow would be symmetrical and
thUS, the resultant would coincide with the X
axis.


Fig. A15.4 also shows the resultant shear
load Q on each portion of the cell wall which
equals the area of the shear flow diagram for
various portions as shown.


ZF z =- 56.9   - 43.1 =- 100, which balances
the external load of 100 lb.


ZF x = 0 by observation. Take moments about
point 0, the intersection of axis XX and side ad.


_ ZM o _ 43.1 x 20 + (-23.8 + 16.58)10 _
x - ZF 100    z 7.90 in.


Hence the shear center lies on the X axis, 7.9"
from side ad.


The moment of the external load of 100 lb.
about shear center equals 100 x 7.9 = 790 in.
lb. clockwise. The moment of the internal shear
flow of Fig. A15.4 is zero thus we have an unbalanced moment of 790. Therefore for equilibrium of moments we must add a constant shear
flow q around cell to develop -790 in. lb. or


_ 11 _    - 790 1.98 Ib/in.
q - 2A    - 2 x 200


Adding this constant shear flow to that of
Fig. A15.4, we obtain the final shear flow
pattern which will be identical to that in
Fig. A15.3 or the results of solution 1.


A15.3 Single Cell - 2 Flange Beam. Constant Shear Flow Webs.

aircraft cellular beam is made up of thin sheet

Since the section and shear flow pattern
is symmetrical about the X axis, the substitution above is written for one-half of the
cell and the results multiplied by 2. When
the shear flow q varies over a portion the
average shear flow is used in the above
substitution.


If the cell is not to twist the relative
tWist of 7000 must be cancelled by adding a
constant shear flow q around the cell to give
a total shear strain of -7000.


The shearing strain for a constant q
equals,

6 = Z ~ = q 5~1 + .~~ + .~~2 = -7000

hence q = "llO6 - -6.36 Ib/in.


Fig. A15.4 shows the resultant shear
flow pattern if the constant shear flow of
-6.36 is added to the shear flow pattern of
A15.2.

walls and webs which are stiffened by members
usually referred to as flange members. A
simplifying common assumption is to assume
that the flange members alone develop the
resistance to the bending moment. This
assumption therefore means that the shear flow
is constant between flange members.


Fig. A15.5 shows a single cell beam with
two flanges at A and B. Find the internal
shear flow force system when the beam carries
the external load of 100 lb. as shown.

hence q1 = 16.21 Ib/in. (sign comes out positive,
hence assumed sense of q1 is correct).


Fig. A15.7 shows a plot of the internal
shear flow resisting system.


A single cell beam having only two flanges
can resist only external loads which are parallel
to the line AB, and thus a two flange box beam
is not used very often in aircraft structure.
When the bending moment in a plane at right
angles to line AB is small, the resistance of
the curved panel to compressive bending stresses
may be SUfficient to resist such external bending moments and thus be satisfactory.


A15.4 Shear Center of Single Cell - Two Flange Beam.


Let it be required to find the shear center
of the beam as given in Fig. A15.5. In other
words where would the external load have to be
placed so that the beam would bend without
twist.

It is assumed that the two flanges
develop the entire bending stress resistance.
This means that shear flow is constant on each
web. Let q1 and qs be the constant shear floW
as shown in Fig. A15.6. The sense or direction
of these shear flows will be assumed as indicated by the arrow heads in the figure.


The force system in the plane of the
cross-section has 2 unknowns, namely q1 and
qs and thus we can solve for q1 and qs by
simple statics.


To find qs take moments about point A.


ZMA = 100 x 10 - qs (2 x 80.52) = 0


hence qs = 1000/lb 161.04 = 6.21 Ib/in.


The sign of qs comes out plUS, thus the
assumed sense of qs as shown in Fig. A15.6 is
correct.


In the above equation of moments about
point A, the moment of the constant flow
system qs about A, equals qs times double the
enclosed area formed by lines running from A
to the ends of the web which carries the shear
flow qs. In this case the area is the area
of the cell, or 80.52 sq. in.


To find the remaining unknown q1 we use
the equilibrium equation,


~Fz = 0 =- 100 - 10 x 6.21 + 10Q1 = 0

Fig. A15.8 shows the resulting shear flow
system in resisting the 100 lb. exterr-al load
acting as shown in Fig. A15.5. This shear flow
system will cause the cell to twist. Therefore
we add a constant shear flow q to the cell to
produce zero twist (Fig. A15.9). The centroid
of the combined shear flow system will then
locate the lateral location of the shear center.


To find q we must write an expression
which measures the twist when SUbjected to the
shear flows of Figs. A15.8 and 9 and equate the
result to zero, and then solve for the one unknown q.


o = ~ ~L = O. (Clockwise q is positive)


Substituting, using the shear flows of Figs.
A15.8 and A15.9,

hence q = 8.26 lb. in.


Adding this constant shear flow to that
of Fig. A15.8, we obtain the shear flow of
Fig. A15.10.


The lateral position of the shear center
is given by the location of the resultant of
the shear flow system of Fig. A15.10.


ZF x = 0


ZF z = 10 x 7.95 + 2.05 x 10 = 100 lb.


Therefore R = 100 lb.


Equate moments of R about point A to
moment of shear flow system about A.


Re = ZMA


100e = 2.05 (2 x 80.52)


e = 3.30 in.


Thus shear center lies 3.30 inches to
left of line AB. (See Fig. A15.10).


Thus if the given external load of 100
lb. acts through the shear center, it will
produce the shear flow system of Fig. A15.10.
However it acts 13.3 to right of shear center,
hence it produces a clockwise moment of 100
x 13.3 = 1330 in. lb. on the cell. For
equilibrium, this moment must be balanced by
a constant resisting shear flow around cell
which will produce a moment of -1330.


            - 1330
The required q = 2 x 80.52 =- 8.26 lb. in.

which if added to the shear flow system of
A15.10 will give the true shear flow system
of A15.8.


Thus having the shear center location,
the external load system can be broken down
into a load through the shear center plus a
moment about the shear center. The shear
flow due to each is then added to give the
true resisting shear flow.


It should be noticed that the web or skin
thickness does not influence the magnitude of
the shear flow system in a single cell beam.
A change in thickness, however, effects the
unit shearing stress and therefore the shearing strain and thus in computing angular twist



**A15.5**


of the cell, the web and wall thickness do
influence the amount of twist for a given
torsional load. In the shear center solution,
it is known what portion of the shear flow is
due to torque or pure twist, and also that due
to bending without twist, which fact is sometimes of importance.


TORSIONAL DEFLECTION OF CELL


The angUlar twist as given by the final
shear flow pattern of Fig. A15.8 equals
2QAG = ZqL/t, whence


2QAG = -6.21 x 24.28 _16.21 x 10 = -10082 __ (3)
.025 .04


After finding the shear center location,
we found that the external load had a moment
of 1330 in. lb. about shear center, which was
resisted by a constant shear flow of - 8.26
Ib/in. The angUlar twist under this pure
torque shear flow should therefore give the
same result as equation (3) above.


2QAG = - 8.26 x 24.28 _ 8.26 x 10 =_ 10082
.025 .04


which checks the result of equation (3).

Fig. A15.11 shows a single cell beam with
three flange members, A, Band C, carrying the
external load as shown. A three flange box if
the flanges are not located in a straight line
can take bending in any direction and therefore
is often used in design because of its simplicity.


For such a structure, there are six **un-**
knowns, namely, the axial load in each stringer
and the shear flow q in each of the three sheet
panels that make up the cell. For a space
structure, we have six static equations of
equilibrium, thus a three flange single cell

beam can be solved by statics if we assume
that the three flange members develop all the
bending stress resistance, thus producing
constant shear flow webs.


Fig. A15.12 shows the cross section ABC.
The three unknown resisting shear flows have
been assumed with a positive sign. (Clockwise
flow is positive shear flow). These three
unknown shear flows can be determined by
statics.


To find qca take moments about point B
and equate to zero.


2MB = 100 x 5 - 25 x 10 + qca(128.54 x 2) = 0


hence qca - - 257.08 - -250 - 0 972 - Ib/in.


To find qab take ZF z = 0


ZF z = 100 - 10 x 0.972 - l0Qab = 0


Qab = 9.13 Ib/in.


To find qbc take ZF x = 0


ZF x - - 15 x 0.972 - 25 - 15qbc = 0


hence qbc =- 2.639 Ib/in.


The signs of qca and qbc came out negative,
hence the sense of the shear flow on these cell
wall portions is opposite to that assumed in
Fig. A15.12. The resulting shear flow pattern
is plotted in Fig. A15.13.


The student should realize the thickness
of the wall elements does not influence the
shear flow distribution if we assume the three
flanges develop the entire resistance to the
bending moment.


A15.6 Shear Center of Single Cell-Three Flange Beam.
Constant Shear Flow Webs.


Let it be required to determine the shear
center location for the beam in Fig. A15.11.
The shear center is a point on the beam crosssection through which the resultant external
shear must act if the cell is to bend without
twist.


The shear center location will be determined in two steps, first its horizontal
location and then its vertical location.


Calculation of horizontal location:

We will assume any vertical shear load,
as the example, the same vertical shear as used
in the problem of Art. A15.4, namely, a 100
lb. load acting five inches from A, as
illustrated in the following Fig. A15.14.

Fig. A15-l6



The three unknown resisting shear flows
will be assumed with the sense as indicated by
the arrow heads.


To find Qac take moments about B


2MB = 100 x 5 - qac (128.54 x 2) = 0


Qac = 1.945 Ib/in.


ZF x =- 15 x 1.945 + 15qbc = 0


qbc = 1.945


ZF z = 100 - 10 x 1.945 - l0Qab = 0


Qab = 8.055 Ib/in.


The algebraic signs of the unknown q value
all come out positive, thus the assumed direction
of shear flows in Fig. A15.14 is correct.


To make the cell twist zero, we must add a
constant shear flow q to the cell (see Fig.
A15.15). The relative twist under the shear
flow of Figs. 14 and 15 will be equated to zero.



Z ~ =_ 1.945 x 20.71 1.945 x 15
t .03 .025


+ 20. 7lq + 10q + 15q = 0

+ 8.055 x 10
.04



Whence, q = 0.322 Ib/in. with sense as
assumed in Fig. A15.15. Adding this constant
shear flow to that of Fig. A15.14 we obtain the
shear flow system of Fig. A15.16. The resultant
R of this shear flow system is obviously - 100
lb., since the external load was 100 lb. The
location of this resultant R will therefore
locate the horizontal position of the shear
center. Equate moment of resultant R about
point B to the moment of the shear flow system
about B, whence,


100e = 1.623 (128.54 x 2)


or e = 417/100 = 4.17 in. from line AB.

Calculation of Vertical Position of Shear Center


A convenient horizontal shear load will be

we will assume the same load in this solution.
Fig. A15.17 shows the loading and the assumed
directions of the three unknown shear flows.

qcb = 0.695


ZF z = 10 x 0.972 - l0Qab = 0


Qab = 0.972


A constant shear flow q is now added to
cell to make twist zero (Fig. A15.18).


Writing ZqL/t for both loadings and
equating to zero:

ZqL/t = 0.972x20.71 _ 0.695x15 + 0.972xlO
.03 .025 .04


+ 20. 7lq + 10q + 15q = 0

whence, q =- 0.324 Ib/in.


Adding this constant shear flow to that of
Fig. A15.17 we obtain the values in Fig.
A15.19.


R (the resultant) = 25 lb.


Equating moment of resultant about B to
moment of shear flow system about B,


Re = 2MB


25e = 0.648 (128.54 x 2)


Therefore e = 6.65 inches.


Thus shear center lies 6.65 inches above B,
and 4.17 inches to left of B as preViously
found.



The beam section which is symmetrical about
the X axis is identical to the beam section
relative to flange material which was used in
example problem 1 of Art. A14.10.


SOLUTION:

Assuming the 8 flanges develop all the
bending stress resistance, the shear flow will
therefore be constant between flanges. Since
the beam section is a closed one the value of
the shear flow q at any point is unknown. Thus
we will imagine the top cover cut between flange
members a and h, thus making q zero in this
panel due to the free end at the cut. We now
find the internal resisting shear flow system
for bending of this open section about axis
x-x under a external shear load V z = 100 lb.


The calculations would be exactly like
those in example problem 1 of Art. A14.10 and
will not be repeated here. Fig. A15.21 shows
the plotted results as recopied from Fig. A14.32.

A15.8 SHEAR FLOW IN CLOSED THIN-WALLED SECTIONS. SHEAR CENT ER.


If ~Fx and ~Fz are considered for equilibrium of external and internal loads, they
will be found to equal zero.


To check ZM y = zero take moments about
some point such as C.


100 x 7.5 + 10 x 3.75 x 15 - 1.25 x 5


     - 1.25 x 10 + 1.25 x 15 =- 187.5 in.lb.



Therefore to make ZM c = 0, a constant
shear flow q equal to M/2A = (187.5/2 x 11 x 15)
= 0.57 Ib./in. is required. Adding this constant shear flow to that in Fig. A15.21, we
obtain the final shear flow pattern of Fig.
A15.22. This final pattern is not much
different from that of Fig. A15.21, the
reason being that the location of the imaginary
cut to make q equal zero, was not far from the
true fact, since the final q in this panel was
only 0.57. If we had started the solution by
assuming the web bc cut or qbc = 0, then the
correction constant flow that would be needed
to satisfy ZM = 0 would have come out q =
-5.88, since this is the final q in web bc.
Since the shear flow which is a load on the
cell wall influences the required thickness of
sheet required, it is good practice to try to
place the imaginary cut at a point where the
shear is near zero, so that preliminary
estimates in routine design relative to shell
thickness required will be based on shear flow
values that are near the final values.

For the given beam loading the external
shear loads at section abcd are,


Vz = 6000 lb., Vx =- 1600 lb.


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-334-full.png)

Substituting in the equation for qy as

point d.


ZMct = 6000 x 8 - 1600 x 8 - 449.78 x 12

Thus for equilibrium a moment of plus
51160 in. lb. is required. This is produced
by adding a constant shear flow q around the
cell walls, where



,Al5.9


Adding this value of q to those in Fig.
A15.24 we obtain the final shear flow resisting
pattern in Fig. A15.25.


Solution 2. Principal Axes Method


The shear flow system can of course be
found by referring section properties and external shear loads to the principal axes of the
beam section. The equation for shear flow is
(see Eq. 15 of Chapter A14),

qy =- r [zp ] Z zpA   - ~Z xpA   - - - - - (5)
xp zp


(The subscript p refers to principal axes.)


The section properties about the principal
axes were computed for this same beam section
on page A13.5 of Chapter A13. The values are:

Ixp = 75.38, Izp = 159.34


Fig. A15.26 which was also taken from page
A13.5 shows the location of the principal axes
and the distances from the four flange members
to the principal axes.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-334-0.png)

Before substitution in equation (5) can be
made, the given shear loads Vz = 6000, and Vx =
-1600 must be resolved normal to the principal

These shear flows are practically the

For equilibrium of moments, take moments
about (b).

A constant shear flow q around cell must
be added to produce 50993 in. lb. for equilibrium. This balancing shear flow is,

q = J:!.. 2A = 2 x 16050993 ::: 159 35. lb/in    

which is the same as in solution no. 1.

Since the value of the shear flow is unknown at any point on the cell walls, it will
be assumed that the cell wall is cut between
flange members 1 and 10, thus making q zero on
the sheet panel numbered (1-10). Then using
equation (7) the shear flow is calculated in
going clockwise around the panel. Columns 1 to
10 of Table A15.1 show the calculations in
solVing equation (7). For explanation on how
to determine sense of shear flows qy in Columns
9, 10, and 11, review Art. A14.6 of Chapter
A14.



Fig. A15.27 illustrates a typical single
cell wing beam with multiple flange members.
The external shear load on this beam section
is Vz = 1000 and Vx = 400 located as shown.
The internal shear flow resisting pattern will

Fig. A15,30 shows a two cell cantilever
beam with 10 flange stringers. The cross-section is constant. Let it be required to determine the internal shear flow in resisting the
1000 lb. load acting as shown. For simplification, the top and bottom sheet covering and
the three vertical webs will be considered ineffective in taking bending flexural loads.
Since the beam section is symmetrical about the
X axis, the beam will bend about this axis in
resisting the given external load. The moment
of inertia of the section about the X axis
equals 250 in. 4

Solution 1 (Without use of shear center)


The internal shear flow is statically indeterminate to the second degree, since the

A15.12 SHEAR FLOW IN CLOSED THIN-WALLED SECTIONS. SHEAR CENTER.



shear flow at any point in each cell is unknown.
Therefore, to make the flexural shear flow
statically determinate, a value for the shear
flow q in each cell will be assumed at some
point, and the flexural shear flow for each
cell will then be calculated, consistent with
the assumed conditions. These resulting static
shear flow systems will, in general, produce a
different total shearing strain around the
perimeter of each cell, or in other words,
produce a different cell tWist. Since full
continuity exists between cells, this condition
cannot exist, and therefore an unknown constant
shear flow of q in cell (1) and q 2 in cell (2)
must be added **t6** make the tWist or both cells
identical. This fact gives us the basis for
one equation and the other equation necessary
for the solution of the two unknowns q1 and q2
is given by the requirement of equilibrium,
namely, that the moment of the external and
the internal shear forces about any point in
the plane of the cross section must equal zero.
In Fig. A15.31 the flexural shear flow has
been assumed as zero just to the left of
stringer c in cell (1) and just right of
stringer c in cell (2). The balance of the
flexural shear system consistent with this
assumption is calculated as follows:


50#/in. 
![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-337-0.png)


Fig. A15-31


The general shear flow equation is,


qy =_ Vz ZzA =_ 1000 ZzA = -4ZzA

Ix 250

Cell (1). Starting in panel cb where the
shear has been assumed zero and proceding
counter-clockwise around cell


qcb = zero (assumed)


%a = -4ZzA = 0-4x5xO.5 = -10 Ib./in.


qaa' = -10-4x5x2 = -50 Ib.lin.


Qa'b' = -50-4x (-5) x2 = -10 Ib.lin.


qb'c' = -10-4x (-5) xO.5 = Olb.lin.


We cannot proceed beyond stringer c' because there are two connecting webs with unknown shear flows. We can get around this
difficulty by going back to stringer c, where
the shear flow on each side of c was assumed



zero. Thus the shear flow in the vertical web
cc ' is determined by the stringer c alone,
namely

qcc' = -4Z~' zA =- 4x 1 x 5 = -20 Ib./in.


We can now continue around cell (2) starting
with stringer c' where we were previously
stopped.

qc'd' = qb'c' + qcc' 4Z~:zA
= 0 20 - 4 x (-5) 1 = 0


qd'e' = 0 4 x (-5) 0.5 = 10 Ib./in.


qe'e = 10 - 4 x (-5) 1 = 30 Ib./in.


qed = 30 - 4 x 5 x 1 = 10 Ib./in.


qdc = 10 - 4 x 5 x 0.5 = 0, which checks
the assumed value of q = 0 in panel cd.


The shear flows in cell (2) could of
course been found by starting in panel cd
where the shear has been assumed zero and
proceeding clockwise around cell as for example


%e = 0 - 4 x 5 x .5 = -10 Ib./in.


qee ' = -10 -4x5xl = -30 Ib./in.



qe'd' = -30


qd'c' = -10



4x (-5) 1 = -10 Ib./in.


4x (-5) 0.5 = 0 Ib.lin.



The magnitude of the results are the same
as previously calculated but the signs are
opposite. As emphasized previously the shear
flow calculated together with its sign is in
the y direction or qy. The direction of the
shear flow along the cell walls in the xz
plane can be detennined by the simple rule as
given in Art. A14.6 of Chapter A14. To illustrate, refer to the free bodies in Figs. A, B,
and C. The shear flow q in panel ba was
calculated to be -10. This value is shown in
Fig. A with its calculated sense and acts
toward the intersection point (0). Then by
the rule of Art. A14.6, qba must also act
x
toward point (0), thus giving the sense as
shown in Fig. A.


To obtain the shear flow in web panel cc',
the calculations started at point c and went
toward point c I. q on this panel was calculated to be -20. The free body in Fig. B
shows this value of qy = -20, acting with its
true sense or acting toward point (0'). Then
qcc must also act toward point (0'), as
z
shown in Fig. B. The free body in Fig. C
shows how the sense of qde was obtained.

One other equation is necessary to solve for

moments of the external and internal shear
forces about any point in the plane of the cross
section, which must equal zero for equilibrium.


Take moments about pOint (b) of the shear
flow system of Figs. A15.31 and A15.32 and also
the external shear load of 1000 lb., which in
this case has no moment about our assumed

moment center.

Solution 2 (By use of shear center)


In this solution, we find the flexural
shear flow for bending about axis X-X without
tWist. The centroid of this internal shear
system locates the shear center. The moment of
the external shear load about the shear center
produces pure torsion on the 2 cell beam. Thus,
adding the shear due to this pure torsion to
that of pure bending, we obtain the final resisting internal shear flow.

Solving equations (5) and (6) for q:l. and q'a>

Therefore, taking these values of q:l. and qe

in Fig. A15.32 and adding the results to that
of Fig. A15.3l, we obtain the shear flow
pattern of Fig. A15.34 which is the shear flow
system for bending without twist about X axis.
The centroid of this shear system locates the
shear center.


In Fig. A15.34,


ZV = 0 = -10 x 45 - 10 x 28 - 10 x 27 =- 1000

lb. ZH = 0 by observation of Fig. A15.34.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-339-0.png)


Fig. A15-34


To find the horizontal position of the centroid
of the shear flow in Fig. A15.34 take moments
about point "a:


Z:t1 a = 10 x 27 x 10 +10 x 28 x 20
+ 5 x 8 x 10 - 5 x 2 x 10 = 8600 in .lb.

hence, x = ~ggg = 8.6" to the right of web aa' 

The external shear load of 1000 lb. acts 5" to
the right of aa', and therefore causes a moment
about the shear center equal to (8.6 - 5.0)
1000 = 3600 in.lb. To resist this torsional
moment, a constant torsional shear flow qt(l)
and qt(2) must act on cells (1) and (2)
respectively.


The values of qt(l) and qt(2) can be found
by using equations (29) and (30) of Art. A6.ll
of Chapter A5. Thus

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-339-2.png)


Since the external torque equals 3600 in.lb.,



the resisting internal torque must therefore
equal -3600. Therefore,


qt(l) = .00254(-3600) = -9.17 lb./in.


Solving for qt(2)


lfa.o:l.Ae + a:l. 2 AJ
qt (2) = 2"[ 31190000 T

2 Q 31190000 .


hence: qt(2) = .00245x-3600 = -8.85 lb/in.


Therefore, if we add to the shear flow system of Fig. A15.34, a constant shear flow of
-9.17 lb./in. to cell (1) and -8.85 lb./in. to
cell (2), we will obtain the true internal resisting shear flow of Fig. A15.35, which checks
solution 1, any discrepancy being due to slide
rule accuracy.

Torsional Deflections


The angular twist of each cell is the same.
The value of the angular twist Q per unit length
of the beam can be found using the shear flow
pattern of Fig. A15.35 which is the true resultant shear flow, or the pure torsional shear flows
of qt(l) = -9.17 lb./in. and qt(2) = -8.85 lb./in.

The results will, of course, be the same.

Solution No.1 (Without use of shear center)


The system is statically indeterminate, to
the third degree, since the value of the shear
flow q at any point in each cell is unknown.


The value of the shear flow will be assumed at a point in each cell and the flexural
shear flow for bending about the XX axis will
be determined consistent with this assumption.
A constant unknown shear flow q J,' q 2' and q"

for cells (1) and (2) and (3) respectively
will be added to the static flexural shear
flow so as to make the angular twist Q of each

cell the same, since if any twisting takes
place, all cells must suffer the same amount.
Furthermore, for equilibrium, the moment of
the internal shear flow system plus the moment
of the external shear load must equal zero 

For bending about axis XX, the flexural
shear flow will be assumed as zero at a point
just to the left of stringer a in cell (3) and
just to the left and right of-stringer c in
cells (1) and (2) respectively. One might consider the cells as cut at these three points.
Fig. A15.37 shows the flexural shear flow under
these assumptions. Since the leading edge cell
(3) has no stringers and the covering is considered ineffective in bending, the shear flow
will be zero on the leading edge portion since
the shear flow was assumed zero just to the left
of stringer a. The resulting flexural shear
flow for the 3 cell section will therefore be
identical to Fig. A15.31 and the calculations
for the flexural shear flow will be identical to
those in Art. A15.7.

A15.11 Shear Flow in Beam with Multiple Cells. Method of
Successive Approximations.


The general trend in airplane structural
design appears to be to the use of a relatively
large number of cells. There are various
reasons for this trend some of which are:
(1) using multiple interior webs, the detrimental effect of shear deformation on bending
stress distribution is decreased; (2) the fail
safe characteristic of the wing is increased
because the wing is made statically indeterminate to a high degree and thus failure of
individual units due to fatigue or shell fire
can take place Without greatly decreasing the
over-all ultimate strength of the wing;
(3) the ultimate compressive strength of wing
flange units is usually increased because
column action is prevented by the mUltiple webs
which attach to flange members.


In Chapter A6, Art. A6.l3, the method of
successive approximation was presented by determining the resisting shear flow system when
a mUltiple cell beam was subjected to a pure
torsional moment. This method of approach has
now been extended to determine the resisting
shear flow when the beam is subject to flexural
bending without tWist*. Using these two methods
the shear flow in a beam with a relatively large
number of cells can be determined rather rapidly
as compared to the usual method of solving a
number of equations.


PHYSICAL EXPLANATION OF THE METHOD


Fig. A15.40 shows a 3-cell beam carrying
and external shear load V acting through the
shear center of the beam section but as yet unknown in location. In other words, the beam
bends about the symmetrical axis X-X without
twist. The problem is to determine the internal
resisting shear flow system for bending without

Aeronautical Society, Feb. 1954.

tWist. In this example, it is assumed that the
bending moment is resisted entirely by the
flange members as represented by the small
circles on the figure, which means that the
shear flow will be constant between the flange
members.


The first step in the solution is to make
the structure statically determinate relative
to shear flow stresses for bending without
tWist. In Fig. A15.41 imagine each cell cut
at points a, band c as shown. For the given
shear load V, the static shear flow qs can be
calculated, assuming the modified section bends
about axis X with no tWist. Fig. A15.41 shows
the general shape of this static shear flow
pattern.

Now consider each cell as a separate cell.
The static shear flow qs acting on each cell
will cause each cell to twist. Since zero
twist is necessary a constant shear flow q~ to
cell (1), q~ to cell (2), and q~ to cell (3)
must be added as shown in Fig. A15.42, and the
magnitudes of such value as to make the twist
of each cell zero. However, the cells are
actually not separate but have a common web between adjacent cells, thus the shear flow q~
acts on web 2-1 which is part of cell (1), and
thus causes cell (1) to twist. Likewise cell
(3) is tWisted by q~ and cell (2) by both q~
and q~. Therefore to cancel this additional
cell twist, we must add additional constant
shear flows q~, q~ and q: as shown in Fig.
A15.43, and considering each cell separate
again. However, since the cells are not separate these additional shear flows effect the
twist of adjacent cells through the common web.
As before this disturbance in cell twist is
again cancelled or made zero by adding further
closing shear flows q~, q:, q: as shown in
Fig. A15.44. This procedure is repeated until
the closing shear flows become negligible. In
general the converging of this system is qUite
rapid and only a few cycles are necessary to
give the desired accuracy of results.


The total closing shear flows qJ.' q2 and
q" [are] [ then] [ equal] [ to] [ -]


qJ. = q~ + q~ + q~ +     - - - 

q2 = q~ + q: + q: +

q" [=] [ q~] [ +] [ q:] [ +] [ q:] [ +]


The final shear flow on any panel then
equals, (See Fig. A15.45)


q = qs + qJ. + q2 + q"   - - - - - - - - - (1 )


The centroid of this final shear flow

and thus equation (7) becomes,

Thus by repeating the above procedure, a
power series of the carryover influence factor
is obtained. In general the convergency is
rapid and only a relatively few cycles or operations are needed for sufficient accuracy for
final shear flows. A solution of a problem
will now be given to show how the necessary
operations form a very simple routine.


A15.12 Example Problem Solution. Problem No. 1.


Fig. A15.47 shows a cellular beam with
five cells. The flange areas and the web and
wall thicknesses are labeled on the figure.
The problem will be to determine the internal
shear flow pattern when resisting an external
shear load of Vz = 1000 lbs. without twist of
the beam. Having determined this shear flow
system the Shear center location follows as a
simple matter.


Fig. A15.48 shows the assumed static
condition for determining the shear flow system
in carrying a Vz load of 1000 lb. without twist.
The static condition is that all webs except
the right end web have been imagined cut as
indicated thus making the shear flow q at
these points zero. s


In this example problem it will be assumed
that the flange members develop all the bending
stress resistance, which assumption makes the
shear flow constant between adjacent flange
members.


The total top flange area equals 5.5 in. [a],
and also the total bottom flange area. Due to
symmetry the centroidal X axis lies at the
mid-depth point.


Hence, Ix = (5.5x5 [a] )2 = 275 in. [4]


qs = _.:!.:£ ~zA =- 1000 ~zA = -3. 636 ~zA
Ix 275


starting at the lower left hand corner,
the static shear flow qs will be computed going
counter-clockwise around beam.



The first term in equation (3) represents
the proportion of the static shear flow qs
which must act as a constant shear flow around
cell (2) to cancel the twist due to qs. The
resulting value of this first term will be
given the term q~.


The second and third terms in (3) represent the constant closing shear flows required
in cell (2) to cancel the twist of cell (2)
due to the influence of q1 and qa in the adjacent cells acting on the common webs between
the cells. The ratio in equation (3) before
q1 will be referred to as the carryover
influence factor from cell (1) on cell (2) and
will be given the symbol C1- a, and the ratio
before qa in equation (3), the carryover
influence factor from cell (3) to cell (2) and
it will be given the symbol Ca_ a• Thus
equation (3) can now be written as,


                   - - - - (4)


As explained above, q~ is the value of the
necessary closing shear flow for zero twist
when the adjacent cell shear flows are zero.
Hence first approximations to the final shear
flows in each cell can be taken as neglecting
the effect of adjacent cells, or in other words
each cell is considered separate. Hence the
first approximations are,


(5 )

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-343-0.png)


By SUbstituting (5) in (4) a second approximation for qa is obtained, namely,


(6)


(7)


where q~ is the correction added to the first
approximation. In a similar manner corrections

q~ and q~ are made to the approximations for
q1 and qa - Therefore as a third estimate for
qa' these further corrections should be added

=- 3.636(-5)2 = 36.36 lb./in.

= 36.36 -3.636(-5)1 = 54.55 lb./in.

= 54.55 - 3.636(-5)0.5 = 63.64



Continuing in like manner around the beam, the
values of qs as shown in Fig. A15.48 would be
obtained.


The solution from this point onward is
made in table form as shown in Table A15.2
which should be located below a drawing of the


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-344-full.png)

**A15.19**



cellular beam as illustrated, and the numbers
in the Table should be lined up with respect
to the cells as indicated.


The solution as presented in Table A15.2
is carried out in 17 simple steps. The first
step as given in row 1 of the Table is to
compute for each cell the value for ~ qs 1.,
t
where qs is the static shear flow on each
sheet panel of a cell; L the length of the
panel and t its thickness. Values for qs are
taken from Fig. A15.48.


For example, for CellI


~ qs ~ = 2(36.36 x 10) .~ = 18180


The sign is positive because qs is positive. (Clockwise shear flow on a cell is
positive.) Row 1 in the Table shows the values
as calculated for the 5 cells.


The second step as indicated in row 2 of
the Table is to calculate the value of the
expression ~ Lit for each cell.


For example, for CellI,


For cell 2,


~....!:...= ~+ 2(10) +.l2.. = 950
"t .05 .04 .04


The third step as indicated in row 3 is to
calculate the value for the Lit of the common
web between two adjacent cells.


For example, for web bb' between cells
(1) and (2),


[L) = ..l2.... = 200
\ t ~-2 .05


The fourth step is to determine the
carryover factor from one cell to the adjacent
cell. The results are recorded in row 4 of
the Table.


Referring to equation (3) for general
explanation, the carryover factor from cell
(1) to cell (2) is,



We are now ready to start the solution
proper by successive approximations. In row 5
of the Table, the first approximation is to
assume a value q' added to each cell which will
cancel the twist due to the static shear flow
when the cell webs are not cut, but each cell
is considered separate or independent of the
other. This constant closing shear flow q'
equals,

L
~qSt
q' = ----L--. The minus sign is necessary

~t


because the tWist under the static shear flow
must be canceled. The values for q' are recorded in row 5 of the Table.


For example for cell (1),


q' = _ 18180 = _ 21.238
856


For cell (2),


I 27275 - 71
q = - 95()   - - 28.


Steps 6 to 13 as recorded in rows 6 to 13
of the Table are identical in operation, namely,
the carryover influence from one cell to the
adjacent cell because of the common web between
the cells. As a closing shear flow is added to
each cell to make the cell tWist zero when they
are considered separate, this result is continually disturbed because of the common web.
Gradually these corrective shear flows become
smaller and smaller until the cells reach their
true state and possess zero tWist. In the
Table, arrows have been used for two cycles
to help clarify the operations.


For example in row 6, the carryover shear
flow from cell (1) to cell (2) is,


    - 6.700 x .2105 =- 1.414


From cell (2) to cell (1), the carryover value
is


(-4.480    - 8.330) 0.2336 =- 3.000


From cell (2) to cell (3),

CALCULATION OF SHEAR CENTER LOCATION

In Fig. A15.47 let x : distance from left end of beam to shear center. Taking moments about
upper left corner of the shear flow forces in Figs. A15.48 and A15.49 and equating to 1000 X.


1000x = 10(36.36+54.55+63.64+72.73+81.82)10 + 100 x 10 x 50    - 2 x 100(33.51 + 52.45 + 63.43 + 73.91
+ 84.39), hence 1000x = 19472 or X = 19.47 inches.

In row 13 of the Table, the carryover
values are so small that the process is terminated. The final constant shear flow that must
be added to each cell to cancel the tWist due
to the static shear flow equals the algebraic
sum of the values from the beginning row 5 to
row 14. The results are shown in row 14 of the
Table.


The results in row 14 are obtained after a
considerable number of multiplications and
additions of numbers, thus it is easy to make a
numerical mistake. To check whether any
appreciable mistakes have been made, we take
the values in row 14 and consider these values
of constant shear flow in each cell as that
causing zero twist if cells are separate. Then
bringing the cells together, through the common
webs causes a disturbance in twist and this is
made zero by the carryover values. This step
in the Table is referred to as a reiteration
and is indicated in row 15. Then adding the
values in row 15 to the initial approximation
q' in row 5, which value is repeated in row 16,
we obtain the final value of q in row 17. The
values in row 17 are practically the same
magnitude as in row 14, thus no appreciable
mistakes have been made. If the difference
was appreciable, then a second, and if needed,
even a greater number of reiterations should
be carried out. In the Table a second reiteration is shown in rows 18, 19, 20 and the
results in row 20 are practically the same as
in row 17.


It will be assumed that the solution was
stopped after first iteration, and thus the
values in row 17 are the constant shear flows
that must be added to the static shear flows
to produce bending Without tWist. Fig. A15.49
shows these final closing constant shear flows.
Adding these values to those in Fig. A15.48 we
obtain the final shear flows in Fig. A15.49.


The lateral location of the shear center
for this given 5 cell beam coincides with the
centroid of the shear flow force system in
Fig. A15.50. The calculations for locating
the shear center are given below Fig. A15.50.


Solution 2 of Problem 1


In solution 1, the assumed static condition involved cutting all vertical webs except
the right end web. Thus the static beam
section became an open channel section and the
resulting static shear flows must obviously be
far different than. the final true shear flow
values, since the webs always carry the greater
shear flows in bending without tWist. This
fact is indicated by the relatively large number of steps required in Table A15.2 to reach
a state where successive corrections were small
enough to give a desired accuracy of final result. Thus it is logical to assume a static



A15.21


condition where the static shear flows in the
webs should be much closer to the final values
and thus hasten the convergency in the successive approximation procedure.


Thus in Fig. A15.51, we have assumed the
top panel in each cell as cut to give the static
condition. The static shear flow is now confined to the vertical webs and zero values for
top and bottom sheet. Table A15.3 shows the
calculations for carrying out the successive

approximation~ and needs no further explanation.
It should be noticed that after the first approximation was made in row 5, only three carry
over cycles were needed in rows 6, 7 and 8 to
obtain the same degree of accuracy as required
in 8 cycles in Table A15.2 for solution 1. Fig.
A15.52 shows the final shear flows which equal
the constant shear flows in each cell from row
9 of Table added to the static shear flows in
Fig. A15.51. These values check the reSUlts of
solution 1 as given in Fig. A15.50, within slide
rule accuracy. In Table A15.3 no reiteration
steps were given. The student should make it a
practice to use such checks.


A15.13 Example Problem 2.
All Material Effective in Bending Resistance.


The general trend in supersonic wing structural design is toward a large number of cells
and relatively thick skins, thus in general, all
cross-sectional material of the wing is effective
in resisting bending stresses and thus the shear
flow varies in intensity along the walls and
webs of the beam cells. Fig. A15.53 shows a ten
cell beam with web and wall thicknesses as
shown. It will be assumed that all beam material is effective in bending. The shear flow
resisting system for bending about the horizontal
axis Without twist will be determined. The Centroid of this system will then locate the shear
center.


Fig. A15.54 shows the static condition that
has been assumed, namely, that the upper sheet
panel in each cell has been imagined cut at its
midpoint, thus making the static shear flow zero
at these points. The static shear flow values
qs are shown on Fig. A15.54. To explain how
they were calculated, a sample calculation will
be given.


The moment of inertia of the entire crosssection about the horizontal centroidal axis is,

Ix for top and bottom skins,
= (50 x 0.125 x 2.5 3,)2 = 78.0
Ix of all webs = (0.912 x 5 3 )/12 = 9.5
Total Ix = 87.5 in 4


For convenience an external shear load
Vz = 8750 lb. will be assumed acting on this
beam section.

Hence, q = -:!z..."L,zA =- 8750 "L,zA =- 100 "L,zA
Ix 87.5

At point (f) there are two other connecting
sheet panels so we cannot proceed past this
joint in calculating the shear flow in the two
connecting sheets at (f).


Thus we go back to point (a) and go
clockwise,

qha = 0 + 100Zh ZA = 0 + 100 (2.5 x 2.5 x 0.125)

With two other webs intersecting at joint

past (f), hence we go to point (m) in cell (2)
where shear flow is zero due to the assumed
cut at point (m).

Now at joint (h) we have the shear flow of 78

flow in the vertical web at (h) equals the sum
of these two shear flows or 156.

Fig. A15.54 shows the calculated static
shear flow values for the entire 10 cells. The
values are recorded at the ends of each sheet
panel and at the midpoints of each sheet panel.
Clockwise shear flow in a cell is positive shear
flow. Since an interior web is part of two adjacent cells, the sign of the shear flow on
vertical webs is referred to the left hand cell
in order to determine whether sense is pas it i ve
or negative.


Having determined the static shear flows
which will be referred to as qs' we can now
start the operations Table A15.4. The first
horizontal row gives the calCUlations of the
twist of each cell under the static shear flOWS,
which is relatively measured by the term
L
ZqsTfor each cell.


With all material effective in bending the
shear flow varies along each sheet. Fig. A15.56
shows this variation on the sheet panels of cell
(1). The term Zqs L/t is nothing more than the
area of the shear flow diagram on each sheet
divided by the sheet thickness. To illustrate,
consider cell (1) in Fig. A15.56.

For lower sheet panel:   

l:qs ~ = 0 (Same figure as for upper sheet)


For left hand vertical web: 
Treating the shear flow diagram as a
rectangle with height 78 and a parabola with
height 98 -78 = 20,


Zq .1=..=-78x5 _(20X5xO.667) =-7142
s t 0.064 0.064


For right hand web of cell (1),


The shear flow diagram is likewise made
up of a rectangle and a parabola.


L 156 x 5 0 667
ZqSt= 0.094 + (186.5-156)5X O:094 =9342


Therefore for entire cell (1)


Zqs ~ = -7142 + 9342 = 2200, Which is the

value in row (1) of Table A15.4 under cell (1).
The results for the other nine cells as calculated in a similar manner are recorded in row
1 of the Table. The procedure as followed in
the remaining rows of Table 4 is the same as
explained in detail for example problem 1. In
Table A15.4 only one reiteration is carried
through as the values in the bottom or last
row are practically the same as arrived at after
the fifth carryover cycle. Adding the constant shear flow values in the last row in the
Table to the static shear flow values in Fig.
A15.54 we obtain the final shear flow values
of Fig. A15.57. The resultant of this shear
flow pattern is a force of 8750 acting down
in the Z direction. Its location would be
through the centroid of the shear flow force
system. Let X equal distance from upper left
hand corner of beam to line of action of shear
flow resultant force.


Taking moments of shear flow force system
of Fig. A15.54 plus the constant shear closing
values in each cell as given in the last row
of Table A15.4 and equating to 8750 x, we
obtain;


Due to uniform static shear flow on each
web: 

M = (156 x 5)( 5 + 10 + 15 + 20 + 25 + 30 + 35
+40 + 45) + 78 x 5 x 50 = 175000


Due to parabolic static shear flow in eachweb:

M = (29.4x5xO.667)(5+10+15+20+25)
+ 25.3 x 5 x 0.667 (30 + 35) + 22.5 x 5 x 0.667
(40 + 45) + 20 x 5 x 0.667 x 50 = 22520


Due to constant closing shear flows as



listed in last row in Table A15.4: 

M = +(-11.31   - 3.57 -1.33 -1.17   - 2.88   - 9.07
     - 4.27      - 5.04 + 5.55 + 22.61) 2 x 25 = - 520


Total Moment = 175000 + 22520 - 520 = 197000
hence x = 197000/8750 = 22.5 in., which equals
the distance from left end of beam to shear
center location.


Referring to the final shear flow values
in Table A15.57, it will be noticed that the
final results are not much different from the
assumed static shear flows with the possible
exception of the two end webs. If we had
assumed all the webs cut except one to form the
static condition, then Table A15.4 would have
required several times as many carryover cycles
to obtain the same accuracy of final results.


A15.14 Use of Successive Approximation Method for Multiple
Cell Beams when Subjected to Combined Bending and
Torsional Loads.


The internal shear flow resisting force
system for a beam subjected to bending and tWisting loads at the same time is carried out in two
distinct steps and the results are added to
given the true final shear flow system. First,
the shear flow resisting system is found for
being without twist as was explained in this
chapter. The results of this first step locates
the shear center. The external load system is
then transferred to the sheat center, which
normally would produce a torsional moment about
the shear center. The internal resisting shear
flow system to balance this torsional moment is
then handled by the successive approximatIon
method as explained and illustrated in detail
in Art. A6.13 of Chapter A6.


A15.15 Shear Flow in Cellular Beams with Variable Moment

of Inertia.

The previous part of this chapter dealt
entirely with beams of constant moment of inertia along the flange direction. In airplane
wing and fuselage structures, the common case
is a beam of non-uniform section in the flange
d1rection. In cases where the change of the
cross-sectional areas is fairly well distributed
between the various flange members which make up
the beam cross section, the shear flow reSUlts
as given by the solution for beams of constant
moment of inertia are not much in error. For
beams where this is not the case, the shear flow
results may be considerably different from the
actual shear flows. This fact will be illustrated later by the solutIon of a few example
problems.


A15. 16 The Determination of the Flexural Shear Flow
Distribution by Considering the Changes in Flange
Loads. (The 1l.P Method. )


Fig. A15.58 shows a single cell distributed


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-350-full.png)

flange beam. Consider the beam acts as a cantilever beam with the bending moment existing at
section (A) being greater than that existing at
section (B) and that the bending moment produces
compression on the upper surface. By the use of
the flexural stress equations, the bending
stress on each stringer can be found, which if
multiplied by the stringer area gives the
stringer axial load. Thus at beam section (B),
let P~, P 2, Pa' etc. represent the axial loads
due to a bending moment M. The external bending

flange members, see Fig. A15.60. Again ZF y = 0,


whence ~Pa + ~P4 + qyd = 0


(~Pa + ~P 4)
or qy =- d


Therefore starting at any place where the
value of qy is known, the change in the average
shear flow to some other section equals



Thus for rectangular sheet panels between
flange members the shear flow qx or qz equals
the average shear qy.


The same rules as previously presented to
determine the sense of qx or qz after having qy
can be used and will not be repeated here.


To show that equation (1) reduces to the
shear flow equation preViously derived and used,
consider a beam with constant cross-section and
take a beam length d = 1 inch. Then,


~ = Vzd = Vz(l) = Vz

~P = ~ ZA =.Y.z... ZA (where A = area of
Ix Ix stringer)


From equation (1) qy =- Z~P


SUbstituting value of ~P found above,

qy = -~ZZA   - - - - - (3) which is the
Ix

shear flow equation previously derived for beams
with constant moment of inertia.


_A15.17_ Example Problem to Compare Results in Using
Equations (1) and (3).


Fig. A15.62 shows a square single cell beam
with six flange stringers. Between points Band
C, the beam has a constant flange section which
is shown in Section B-B. The numerals beside
each stringer represent the area of the stringer.
Between points Band D, the flange material
tapers uniformly with the flange material at
point A as indicated in Section A-A. It should
be noticed that the increase in flange area is



qy =- Z ~ - - - - - - -

If the summation is started where qy is zero
then equation (1) will give the true average
shear flow qyo

Imagine the upper sheet panel 2, 2', 3,

a free body in Fig. A15.59. Let qy be the
average shear flow per inch over the distance
d on the sheet edge bb. It has been assumed
positive relative to sense along y axis.


For equilibrium of this free body,


ZF y = 0, hence ~Pa + qyd = 0


whence qy =- ~Pa/d

obtained by increasing only corner stringers b
and c. The shear flow on section A-A will be
computed using equation (3) which applies only
to beams with constant section and also by
equation (1) which applies to beams with varying moment of inertia.


Solution 1. Using Shear Flow Equation for
Beams of Constant Cross-Section.
(Equation 3)


Since q at any point on the cell is unknown, it will be assumed that the upper surface on Section A-A is cut through the midpoint
of flange stringer (a), thus making the shear
flow qy equal to zero on this free surface.
One-half of stringer (a) thus acts with each
side of the top surface. In this solution the
webs and walls will be assumed ineffective in
resisting bending stresses, thus the shear flow
is constant between adjacent stringers.

Proceeding around the cell the balance of the
shear flow c·ould be calculated, but due to symmetry enough values have been found for the
shear flow to draw the complete shear flow picture for bending about the X axis when it is
assumed that one-half of the area of stringer
(a) acts with each adjacent web. Fig. A15.63
shows the resulting shear flow diagram. The
resultant of this shear flow pattern is a
1000 lb. force in the Z direction and its
location through the midpoint of the box since
the flow is symmetrical. The external load of
1000 lb. also acts through the midpoint of the
cell hence the external load is in equilibrium



with the shear flow system of Fig. A15.63, which
therefore is the final shear flow system for
this method of sOlution.

Bending moment at section AA = 1000 x 50 = 50000

Bending moment at section BB = 1000 x 30 = 30000

Considering Section B-B:
Bending stress intensity at midpoint of
stringers by the flexural formula:

Axial load in each of the stringers a, b, and
c = 1000 x 1 = 1000 lb.


Considering Section A-A:


ab -- IX Mz _ 50000 x 5 - 1000   - 250   - ps •i


Axial load in stringer (a) = 1000 x 1 = 1000 lb.


Axial load in stringer (b) or (c) = 1000 x 2 =
2000 lb.


These resulting axial loads are shown acting on the portion between points A and B in Fig.
A15.65, which equals the results as shown in Fig.
A15.66.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-351-1.png)


Having found the ~P flange loads over a
length (d) of 20", the shear flow can be computed by equation (1).


It will be assumed that one-half of the ~P
load in stringer (a) will flow to each adjacent
wet. However, there is no ~P load in stringer
(a) hence Qab = Qac = O. Then from equation (1),

Due to symmetry the left side of cell would
give the same results. The results are plotted
in Fig. A15.64. Since the increase in section
moment of inertia between beam points B and A is
increasing at the same rate as the external
bending moment, the average shear of 50 Ib./in.
is constant between the two beam section A and
B. Comparing Figs. 63 and 64, we find the
first method gives a shear flow of 10 Ib./in.
in the top and bottom webs, whereas actually it
is zero. This seems reasonable since the entire
increase of flange area was placed in stringers
band c.


Example Problem No.2


The same beam as in Problem 1 will be used
except that the cross-sections at beam points B
and A are as shown in Fig. A15.67. The increase
in flange area between beam points B and A has
been placed entirely in stringer (a) which
changes from 1 sq. in. at B to 3 sq. in. at A.

The results of using equations (3) and
(1) relative to the shear flow pattern are
given in Figs. A15.68 and A15.69 respectively.
(The stUdent should check these results.) It
should be noticed that the true shear flow is
greater in the top and bottom skin than that
given by equation (1) which applies only for
beams of constant cross-section.

Thus having the shear flow on the stringer

equation (5).


A15.19 Example Problem of Shear Flow in Tapered
Multiple Flange Single Cell Beam.


Fig. A15.72 shows a tapered single cell
beam with 6 spanwise stringers or flange members.
The beam is loaded by a 1000 lb. load located as
shown. Assuming the webs ineffective in bending
the internal resisting shear flow pattern will
be determined.


In this solution the shear flow at Station
120 will be determined by considering the 6P
flange loads over a length of 30" or between
Stations 90 and 120.

Major aircraft structural units such as
the wing, fuselage, etc., are tapered in both
plan form and depth and therefore the sheet
panels between flange members usually are
tapered in width. Fig. A15.70 shows a cantilever beam tapered in depth and carrying a

Since panel ab is tapered in Width from 6"
at station 120 to 5.5" at station 90, the shear

equation (5).

qZ(cc' ) [=] 47.12x8.5/10 = 40.0 lb./in.


Since the ~P loads are the same on the
lower stringers but tension the shear flow calcUlations if continued would give the same
values as found on the top surface. Fig. A15.74
shows the shear flow pattern on station 120.


IN PLANE FORCES PRODUCED BY INCLINATION

OF FLANGE MEMBERS


Since the box tapers in depth and Width, the
flange stringers are not normal to section 120,
thus X and Z force components are produced on
section by the stringer loads.


These in plane force components are:

Consider beam section at Station 90:

The forces in Fig. A15.74 will be checked
for equilibrium.


ZF z = 1000 - 266.6   - 200 -133.4 -10 x 40 = 0


ZF x = 0 by observation.

For equilibrium a
moment of -8670 is
needed, which is
provided by a constant
shear flow q = M/2A =
-8670/240 = -36.1 Ib./in.

This same beam and loading will now be
solved using the shear flow equation derived
for beams of constant cross-section.


Since the stringers are not perpendicular
to the beam cross-section they have a z force
component which thus assists in carrying the
external shear load in the z direction. These
P z components at station 120 have been calculated in the other· solution.


ZP z **=-** (2x133.3+2xlOO+2x66.7)=-600 Ib


Total Vz (external) = 1000 lb.


Let VZ(net) be shear load to be taken by

cell walls,


VZ(net) = Vz -ZP z = 1000 - 600 = 400 lb.


Calculation of static shear flow assuming
q in sheet panel aa" is zero.

qy(ab) = VZi~et) ZZA = 400 [x5x4] =17.8
450 lb. in.


This corresponds to value of 23.2 in
previous solution (see Fig. A15.74).

qy(bc) = 17.8+~gx5x3 = 31.11b./in.


As compared to 37.2 in Fig. A15.74.

qy(cc') = 31.1+~gx5x2 = 40.0 Ib.in.


Which is the same as in Fig. A15.74.



A15.29


Taking moments about point a of the forces
in Fig. A15.74 but replacing the shear flows in
the top and bottom panels by the values found
above, we would obtain an unbalanced moment of
7970 in. lb. instead of 8670 previously found.
The correcting shear flow would then be q =
-7970/240 = -33.2 instead of -36.1 as previously
found. The final shear flow pattern would be
as shown in Fig. A15.76, which values should be
compared to those in Fig. A15.75.

**MEMBRANE STRESSES** **IN** **PRESSURE** **VESSELS**


**ALFRED** **F.** **SCHMITT**



A16.1 Introduction.

The structural designer is often called
upon to develop a vessel which is to contain a
fluid under pressure. Occasionally the design
of such a vessel is not critical from either a
weight or shape standpoint and almost any suitably strong sealed vessel will suffice. More
often, the strength, weight and form of such a
unit are closely prescribed and rigidly controlled. ThUS, the pressurized cabin of a
modern aircraft is a sealed pressure vessel containing an atmosphere at near sea level pressures and Whose functional requirements include:

i-the transmittal of heavy loads from
the tail surfaces and from internal dead loads,

ii   - the necessity for nonstructural cutouts for doors and windows,

iii   - an efficient shape from both the aerodynamic and space utilization points of view,

iv   - a minimum of weight.

Structurally, the most efficient form of
pressure vessel is one in which the lateral
pressures are supported by tensile stresses
alone in the curved walls of the vessel. Examples of such shapes are those assumed by
pressurized rUbber balloons and canvas fire
hoses and by the free surface of a drop of
water (in which the surface tension forces provide the support). The walls of these vessels
have zero bending stiffnesses and hence have the
properties of a membrane. The stresses developed, lying wholly in tangential directions at
each point, are called membrane stresses.
In shells of technical importance, the
walls do, of course, have some bending stiffness
and hence may carry some transverse loadings by
flexural stresses. Indeed, the boundary conditions imposed on the shell may be sucll as to
necessitate some localized bending near edges
and seams. An efficient pressure vessel design
is one in which the configuration minimizes these
departures from a true membrane stress system,
i.e., minimizes the degree of local bending
stresses induced.


A16.2 Membrane Equations of Equilibrium: Shells of
Revolution Under Rotationally Symmetric Pressure
Loadings.

Consider the equilibrium of a differential
element cut from the shell of revolution of Fig.
A16-1. (The figure is drawn to resemble a
familiar folding paper Christmas bell, since
such an object may aid in visualization.) The
element is cut out by the intersection of a pair



of adjacent meridian curves and a pair of adjacent parallels.

Fig. A16.1


The radii Rm and Rt shown on the figure
are found by erecting local normals to the surface of the element at its corners. Rm is the
radius of curvature of the meridian curve: it
may be either positive (inward pointing), negative (outward pointing as in Fig. A16-1), or infinite (at inflection points or straight-line
meridian segments). Rt is the radius Df curvature of the section normal to the meridian
curve. For simple forms of pressure vessel Rt
is always positive; all radii Rt point inward
and intersect the axis 0-0, although not generally normal to 0-0 (see radius Rt erected from
point C of Fig. AI6-1).
Fig. A16-2 is a detail of the surface element. The forces per unit length* in the meridional and tangential directions are denoted by
lim and Nt, respectively. Shear stresses are

Since shear stresses are absent everywhere
in the meridional and tangential directions,
these are the directions of principal stresses.
Hence the greatest combined normal stress is
identically equal to the greatest meridional or
tangential stress as just computed. It is seen
to be

In computing reinforcing ring stresses

some effective skin from the adjacent shell
walls when the ring cross sectional area is
figured.

This last result is important since it indicates that compressive tangential stresses are
possible if a> b...[2. As will be seen below,
such a situation is undersirable because of the
large resultant difference in radial expansions
between the cylinder and bulkhead (the bulkhead
actually contracts radially if Nt is negative)
producing high secondary bending stresses in the
vessel walls.


Example Problem 4.
Determine the weight per unit length of the
double-cylinder fuselage cross section as a
function of the internal pressure, allowable
stress and the geometric parameters of Fig.

to maintain equal membrane stresses in the skin

fact that RU sin a], = RL sin all)


W = ~ lRU (n  - a], + ~ sin 2 _a],)_ _+_

Since one may show that the cross sectional area of this
fuselage is

an important consequence of this calculation is that the ratio
of shell weight to shell volume is

w _ 2wp

and is therefore independent of the combinations of RU, RL,

shape parameters so as to satisfy other requirements.

yielding of the material will level them out.
However, such stress peaks may prove to be of
great importance in cases of repeated loadings
wherein fatigue failure ~ considered likely.
To point up the major weakness in the membrane analysis one need only compute the radial
displacements in the two different elements that
make up the pressure vessel of Fig. A16-5, viz;,
the cylinder and the hemispherical bulkhead. By
Hooke's law, the tangential strain in the cylinder is


(fl. = Poisson's
ratio, = .3 for
aluminum)



R      - (h - y) tan a By integration the radial displacement of any
t - cos a point on the cylinder is seen to be (ref. Fig.

Then from eq. 1, at any level y

To find the meridional stresses Nm in the

A16.4 Displacements, Boundary Conditions and Local
Bending in Thin Walled Shells.
It is appropriate at this point to examine
some of the foregoing illustrative cases to determine whether or not the membrane stresses
computed gave satisfactorily accurate measures
of the shell stresses. Anticipating the answer,
we state that, while the membrane analysis will

~ive the primary stress system in a shell-like
pressure vessel, a careful (and often lengthy)
analysis of induced bending caused by boundary
effects will reveal localized secondary stress
peaks. In static strength analyses of properly
designed* vessels it is the practice to neglect


- various codes and standards give proportions of common
vessels which will correctly limit secondary stresses.
See .for example reference (1).

Adjacent to the seam, the tangential strain

Hence, by integration

Thus the cylinder tends to expand more than
the bulkhead - a situation prevented by the seam
between these elements. It follows then that
the seam experiences a transverse shearing action
as indicated in Fig. A16-11. These shear forces
in turn produce bending moments in the shell
wall as shown on the figure.

A16.6 MEMBRANE STRESSES IN PRESSURE VESSELS



While it is not our purpose here to take up shell bending
in detail, some indication of the character and magnitude of
these bending stresses should be available to place them in
proper perspective. The most striking thing about these wall
moments is that they are quickly damped out, becoming negligibly small (down to 1'10 of their maximum value) at a distance
of about 4VRc;t from the seam. Thus, for an instance, in a
circular cylindrical shell of 40" radius and. 065" wall thickness, these moments are so damped at 6.5" from the seam.


The next important consideration is an appreciation of
the magnitude of these secondary bending stresses. For the
case of the pressure vessel of Fig. A16-5, the meridional
stresses are increased about _3<Y,0_ at the point of maximum
moment, while the tangential stresses are increased only
about 30/0, Fortunately, in this class of vessel, the tangential
stresses are the ones designed by (they are twice as great as
the meridional stresses) and hence the secondary stresses
have little importance for this case (see Chap. 11, pp. 389-<;22
of reference 2). In other configurations one is not always so
fortunate, and detailed analysis may be required. (see refecences 3, 4, 5 and 6).

The situation at the seam of the above
vessel is typical of many seams or boundaries
where elements are joined which would experience
different expansions if loaded separately.
Among such seams and boundaries are those:

i-where the meridional curvature changes
abruptly. It changes from Rm = R o
to Rm = QO at the seam in Fig. A16-5.
ii   - where a SUdden change in direction of
the meridian curve occurs. In Example
Problem 5, above, considerable shell
wall bending would be induced near the
seam. In fact, a reinforcing ring
would probably have to be added at the
seam as was done in Example Problem 2,
above.*
iii   - at which structural members of different stiffnesses and different loadings
join. In Example Problem 2, the cylinder tends to expand the most, the
bulkhead quite a bit less and the reinforcing ring, being loaded in compression, tends to contract. Other
seams and/or boundaries of this type
are those where an abrupt change in
shell wall thickness occurs (addition
of a doubler) or where a shell is fastened into a foundation.


Good design tends to minimize the magnitude
of the secondary bending stresses by avoiding
combinations of elements which would have highly
incompatible distortions. ThUS, the analysis of
Example Problem 3 shows that if one closes a
circular pressure cylinder with an elliptical
bulkhead in Which a = 2 b, compressive tangential stresses would develop in the bulkhead. In
such a case the bulkhead would tend to contract
radially while the main cylinder would tend to
expand as always. Thus, the shear and induced
moment at the seam would be aggravated, prodUCing (as it happens) a tangential maximum stress

13% above the membrane stress (as against only
3% above for the hemispherical bulkhead) (reference 2, p. 410). For this type of bulkhead,
boiler codes sometimes permit a ratio of alb as
high as 2.6, however.


A16.4 Special Problems in Pressurized Cabin Stress
Analysis.
Because of functional requirements over
and above those of a simple pressure vessel,
the pressurized cabin shell of an airplane has
a number of stress analysis problems peculiar
to its configuration. Several of the more
general of these will be considered here.


DISTRIBurION OF STRESSES BETWEEN SHELL


AND STRINGERS.


To stabilize the shell wall in transmitting heavy tail loads through the fuselage,
longitudinal stringers are added. These
same stringers will also help to carry the
meridional pressure loads. The skin and
stringers must, of course, have equal strains
in the longituditudinal_ directions but, because
the skin is in a two-dimensional state of stress,
they cannot have equal longitudinal stresses:
hence the following analysis.
Let the meridional (longitudinal) stresses
in the skin and stringers be 3m and sL, respectively. St will be the tangential (hoop) stress
in the skin. From eq. (1) we again have


P R o
St = -t

If N is the total number of stringers, each of
cross sectional area AL' then eqUilibrium longitudinally requires


The condition of equal longitudinal strai~ in
the skin and stringers yields


where ~ is Poisson's ratio (= .3 for aluminum).
SolVing these three equations one finds


= P R o (1 + 2 ~ _a)_ (1 + .6 _a)_
2t (1 + _a)_ (1 + _a)_


P R o (1     - 2 j.l) _ p R o .4
sL = 2t (1 + _a)_   - 2t (1 + _a)_


where _a_ = NAL/2n Rot is the ratio of total
stringer area to skin area. A little study will
show that t(l + _a)_ is a sort of "effective shell
wall thickness": it is the result of taking all
the cross sectional area (skin plus stringers)


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-364-full.png)

and distributing it uniformly around the perimeter. On this basis, the results are a little
disappointing: the stringers are carrying only
40% of the stress one might expect if the net
longitudinal load (p n R~) were distributed
evenly over the entire cross sectional area
(2 n Rot (1 + _a))._
The meridional skin stresses are reduced by
the factor (1 + .6 a)/(l + _a)_ from what they
would be without the stringers. For structures
of usual proportions this decrease may amount to
20 to 30% but clearly can never exceed 40%. Inasmuch as the bending stresses due to tail loads
will be superposed on these pressure membrane
stresses, the reduction is certainly beneficial*.


INTERACTION BETWEEN RINGS AND SHELL.


Because of the necessity for transmitting
various concentrated loads from within the cabin
and from the wings and tail to the main shell
and because it is also necessary to provide some
lateral restraint which will stabilize the
stringers and skin against an overall instabilit
failure, the pressurized fuselage of an airplane
contains a considerable number of rings and
frames distributed along the length of the shell.
These rings are seldom, if ever, spaced closely
enough such that they can be considered effective in carrying a part of the hoop stresses (in
the way the stringers were effective in carrying
part of the meridional stress). Rather, they
act more like widely spaced restraining bands
having the effect shown exaggerated in Fig.
AI6-12.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-364-0.png)


Fig. A16.12 Restraining rings along a pressurized tank. The action is representative of a
fuselage with widely spaced rings inside.


It is obVious that the rings in this case
will produce secondary bending stresses in the
skin and hence may have a detrimental effect on
the simple membrane stress system. Equally
harmful are the tensile loadings developed in
the rivets joining the skin and rings. Detailed
analyses which will permit quantitative evalu

 - If one looks at the problem from the point of view of a
stiffened shell, loaded primarily by bending and shear loads
from the tail, on which the pressure membrane loadings are
to be superposed, an interesting effect appears. Because
the internal pressure tends to stabilize the curved skin
panels on the compression side, the effective width of skin
acting with the stringers is increased. The section properties of the cross section may then change in such a way as
to produce little or no variation in the maximum fiber
stresses. Indeed, the maximum tensile stresses may actually be reduced by the addition of the internal pressure loading! (see reference 7).



A16.7


ations of these effects in a specific case are
to be found in references 2 (PP. 395-406), 6
and 8.
One proposed solution to the ring-shell
interaction problem is the floating skin.
Basically, the idea is to reduce the radial
stiffness of the connection between the shell
and the rings so as to allow the shell to expand freely under the pressure loading. The
connection between ring and skin must still retain its shear stiffness so that ring loads may
be transferred to the shell wall by tangential
shear flows. Fig. A16-13 shows the basic idea
of the radially flexible connection. Many

a radially flexible connection.


variations of this type of "mount" suggests
themselves, some of which may have merit for
other reasons. For instance, the transmittal
of wind and other vibration noise into the
cabin of a high speed transport is a problem
which might be treated simultaneously by the
proper choice of connection between the ring
and the shell.


DOORS AND WINDOWS.


The various cutouts in the shell of a
pressurized cabin require special consideration if an excessive weight penalty is to be
avoided.
Consider the panel removed from the pressurized cylinder of Fig. A16-14a. Following a



![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-364-1.png)

common practice in dealing with cutouts, we
determine what forces the panel-to-be-removed
applies to the main structure around the border
of the cutout, and then superpose a set of
equal but opposite, self-equilibrating stresses
to cancel these. The cutout border is then unstressed and the panel may be removed without
disturbing the new stress system in the main
structure.


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-365-full.png)

**A16. B** **MEMBRANE STRESSES** **IN** **PRESSURE VESSELS**



In examining the figure to determine what
sort of canceling stress system must be supplied,
we see that the tangential hoop stresses bordering the cutout cannot be canceled by a selfequilibrating set since they have a radial component. However, the radial component of these
stresses will actually be supplied by the door
or window pressing outward against its frame.
Hence, it is only the component of the hoop
stresses along a chord which need to be canceled
(Fig. A16-14b)*.
The immediate problem becomes one of designing a structure to effectively support a set
of uniformly distributed self-equilibrating
stresses acting in the plane of the chord connecting the upper and lower edges of the opening

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-365-0.png)


**Fig.** **A16.15**

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-365-1.png)


All that appears necessary to support the
stress system is to provide horizontal headers
at the top and bottom of the cutout, Which, as
beams, will carry the loads across to the sides
of the frames Where the loads cancel (Fig. A1615b). For cutouts of usual sizes in pressurized
fuselages, the stress system to be supported in
this manner is qUite large and it proves uneconomical to design a single horizontal frame
member of sufficient bending stiffness to resist
them. Instead, the shell wall itself is employed to help carry these loads across. The
skin is used to form a beam of considerable
depth, the skin being the web of this beam, with
the horizontal frame member and one or more
longitudinals forming the beam flanges (Fig. A1615C) •
Because of the heavy shear flows and direct
stresses developed, the skin is usually doubled
in this region. Additional stringers may also
be added to relieve the stresses. The rings
bordering the cutout (and forming part of the
frame) are extended some distance above and below the cutout proper (unless they coincide with
a regular ring location, in Which case they
carryall the way around).


***** **Clearly** **one of the design requirements** **will** **be to make the**
**frame** **sufficiently stiff in bending against radial** **forces** **so**
**that the door** **or** **window can bear** **up** **evenly against the**
**frame.**



Fig. A16-16 shows the typical cutout
structural arrangement. While analytical
approaches have been tried, it is probably
safe to say that the true elastic stress distribution in such a configuration cannot be
computed. The necessity for avoiding high
intensity stress concentrations (With their
attendant fatigue likelihood) makes empirical
information most useful in such cases. On
the other hand, a simple rational analysis,
based on principles outlined above, will very
likely suffice for a static strength check and
for most design purposes.
The above discussion has concentrated
attention on the problems of carrying the hoop
stresses around a cutout. The longitudina-l--pressure stresses, while being smaller themselves, are intensified by bending stresses
from the tail loads. Hence, the longitudinal
stresses across the cutout may make this condition (or the combination) most severe.

LARGE DEFLECTIONS OF PLANE PANELS; "QUILTING".


The use of flat skin panels in a pressurized fuselage cannot always be avoided. Since
the thin skin has little bending stiffness, it
cannot support the lateral pressure as a beam
("plate", more correctly) and hence must deflect
to develop some tensile membrane stresses which
will then carry the loading. The resultant
bulges of the rectangular skin panels between
their bordering stiffeners give a "quilted" appearance to the surface.
Even in the case of curved skin panels
quilting will occur: if the internal stiffening
framework (transverse rings and frames and
longitudinal stringers) is relatively rigid and
is everywhere tightly fastened to the Skin,
then each skin panel is restrained along its


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-366-full.png)

four sides (borders) against the radial expansion normally associated with the shell membrane
stresses. The result is a sort of three-dimensional-case of the behavior depicted in Fig.
A16-12* •
From a structural viewpoint, the unfortunate aspects of quilting lie in the high concentration of stresses occurring near the panel
edges and in the tensile loadings on the rivets
which join shell to stiffeners. The aerodynamic characteristics of a quilted surface are
highly undesirable in a high performance airplane; hence again qUilting is to be avoided.
Computations of stresses in quilted panels,
inasmuch as they involve large, nonlinear deflections, are difficult. An additional (and
qUite necessary) complication is that of having
to introduce the stiffness properties of the
bordering members. The reader is referred to
Chapter A.17 for a further discussion of the
problem. A simplified approach, indicative of
trends, is given there along with further references to the literature.


A16.5 Shells of Revolution Under Unsymmetrical Loadings.
Problems in which the shell of revolution
experiences unsymmetrical loadings are not uncommon in aircraft structural analysis. The
nose of a fuselage, the external fuel tank and
the protruding radome are shells of revolution
which may be loaded unsymmetrically by external
aerodynamic pressures. Again, the same external
fuel tank shell receives an unsymmetric internal
hydrostatic pressure load from th~ weight of
fuel directed normal to the shell axis.
Because of the unsymmetry of the problem,
membrane shear stresses are now present and so
the analyst must solve not two, but three equations in three unknowns (Nm, Nt and Ns )' Moreover, these become differential rather than
algebraic equations.
Because the derivation of the differential
equations of equilibrium is rather lengthy, and
because their general solution cannot be written
(rather, only specific solutions for certain
cases may be be found), no details are reproduced here. The reader is referred to pp. 373379 of reference 2 for the derivation of the
equations and for an example problem.


- One design which reduces quilting in the curved skin,
fastens rings and frames to the inner surface of "hat" section
stringers only. Thus the ring is not directly fastened to the
skin which is therefore not continuously restrained around
each ring circumference. The result is a modified floating
skin.

**CHAPTER** A -17

**BENDING** **OF** **PLATES**


**ALFRED** **F.** **SCHMITT**



A17. I Introduction.
It was seen in the last chapter that thin
curved shells can resist lateral loadings by
means of tensile-compressive membrane stresses.
As will be seen later, thin flat sheets, by deflecting enough to provide both the necessary
curvature and stretch, may also develop membrane stresses to support lateral loads. In the
analysis of these situations no bending strength
is presumed in the sheet (membrane theory).
In contrast to the membrane, the plate is
a two-dimensional counterpart of the beam, in
which transverse loads are resisted by flexural
and shear stresses, with no direct stresses in
its middle plane (neutral surface).
The skin may also be classified as either a
plate or a membrane depending upon the magnitude
of transverse deflections under loads. Transverse deflections of plates are small in comparison with the plates' thicknesses - on the order
of a tenth of the thickness. On the other hand,
the transverse deflections of a membrane will be
on the order of ten times its thickness.*

Unfortunately for the engineers' attempt at an orderly
cataloging of problems, most aircraft skins fall between the
above two extremes and hence behave as plates having some
membrane stresses.


Plate bending investigations have for a
longtime been important in aircraft structural
analyses in their relation to sheet buckling
problems. Recently they have assumed new importance with the introduction of thick skinned
construction and still more recently with the
use of very thin low aspect ratio wings and
control surfaces which behave much like large
plates, or even are plates in some cases.
It is the purpose of this chapter to present briefly the classic plate formulas and
some applications. Appropriate references are
cited in lieu of an exhaustive treatise, which
could hardly be presented in one chapter (or
even one volume) as Witness the voluminous
literature on the SUbject.


A17.2 Plate Bending Equations **.
Technical literature in this field abounds
with many excellent and elegant derivations of
the plate bending equations (references I and 2,
for instance). Rather than labor the subject


 - As will be seen later, the presence or absence of membrane stresses is not wholly dependent upon the magnitude
of deflections, but is also determined by the form of deflection surface assumed by the sheet (in turn dependent upon
the shape of boundary and loading).


** the assumptions implicit in the following analysis are
spelled out in detail in Art. Al 7. 5, below.

The twist of the element, a [2] w/axay

with another such, we write the equations down
by a direct appeal to past experience and
intuition.
Fig. A17-1 shows the differential element
of a thin, initially flat plate, acted upon by
bending moments (per unit length) Mx and My about
axes parallel to the y and x directions respectively. Sets of twisting couples M xy (= - Myx)
also act on the element.

As in the case of a beam, the curvature in
the x,z plane, a 2 w /ax [2 ], is proportional to the
moment Mx applied. The constant of proportionality is l/EI, the reciprocal of the bending
stiffness. For a unit Width of beam I = t 3 /12.
In the case of a plate, due to the Poisson
effect, the moment My also produces a (negative)
curvature in the x, z plane. ThUS, altogether,
with both moments acting, one has

give the moments in terms of the curvature.

Equations (1), (2) and (3) relate the applied
bending and twisting couples to the distortion
of the plate in much the same way as does
M = EI d 2 Y/dx 2 for a beam.
While a few highly instructive problems may
be solved with these equations (see reference 1,
pp. 45-49 and reference 2, pp. 111-113), they
are of little technical importance. Hence we
move on to consider bending due to lateral loads.
Fig. A17-2 shows the same plate element as
in Fig. A17-1, but with the addition of internal
shear forces Qx and Qy (corresponding to the nV [n]
of beam theory) and a distributed transverse
pressure load q (psi). With the presence of
these shears, the bending and twisting moments
now vary along the plate as indicated in Fig.
A17-2a. (For clarity, the several systems of
forces on the plate element were separated into
the two figures of Fig. A17-2. They do, of
course, all act simultaneously on the single
element)

Fig. A17. 2. The differentials are increments which
should be written more precisely as, for instance,

d~y ~ (a~y/aY)dy.


The next relations are obtained by summing
moments in turn about the x and y axes. For example, we visualize the two loading sets of Fig.
A17-2 acting simultaneously on the single element, and sum moments about the yaxis.


Mx dy + (Myx + d Myx) dx + (Qx + d Qx ) dx dy =


(M x + d Mx ) dy + Myx dx


Dividing by dx dy and discarding the term of
higher order gives


Q =aMx_~
x ax a y


or,



In a similar manner, a moment summation about
the x axis yields


(5 )


(Equations (4) and (5) correspond to V = dM!dx
in beam theory).
One final equation is obtained by summing
forces in the z direction on the element:


(6)


Equations (4), (5) and (6) provide three
additional equations in the three additional
quantities Qx, Qy and q. The plate problem is
thus completely defined.
To summarize, we tabulate below the quantities and equations obtained above. For comparison, the corresponding items from the
engineering theory of beams are also listed.

Finally, one very important equation is
obtained by eliminating all internal forces

(M x, My, M xy, Qx, Qy) between the above six
equations. The result (which the student
should obtain by himself as an exercise) is a
relation between the lateral loading q and the
deflections w*:



Qx = a Mx + a Mxy _
(4 )
a x a y (7 )


*** If w, _the_ deflection function, is a continuous function of
portant x and y _plate_ (as _it_ _problem)_ must _be, then_ of course, at each _in_ _point_ any _a_ _technically_ _[2]_ _w/axdy_ _=_ _im-_ _*_ _the_ corresponding _equation_ for a _simple_ beam is
a~;aydx, as is proven in _the_ calculus. q/EI = d.y/dx  - .


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-370-full.png)

The plate bending problem is thus reduced
to an integration of eq. (7). For a given
lateral loading q (x, y), a deflection function
w (x, y) is sought Which satisfies both eq. (7)
and the specified boundary conditions. Once
found, w (x, y) can be entered into eqs. (1) to
(5) to determine the internal forces and stress
es.

Hence the required deflection surface (and the
solution to the problem**) has the equation

In a similar manner the transverse shears
may be found from eqs. (4) and (5).
With such results as these the plates'
stresses may be determined as desired. For
example, the maximum direct bending stresses
are seen to occur where the shear stresses (due
to Mxy ) are zero. Thus



w = A mn sin m n x a sin n n y b (9) Sx (= MC) I = Mxt 21



Where A mn is the unknown deflection amplitUde.
This trial deflection function is known to satisfy the boundary conditions on the plate since
at x = 0, a and at y.= 0, b we have

w = ° (zero deflection at the supported
edges)


° (zero moment at the hinged
edges: see eqs. 1 and 2)


It remains only to find the value of A mn which
will satisfy eq. (7). SUbstituting (8) and (9)

The reader haVing a familiarity with Fourier series
methods will recognize immediately that the above analysis
provides the key to the solution of the problem of any general
loading q (x, y) on the same plate. Such an application is
made by determining the proper combination of sinusoidal
pressure terms (each of the form of eq. 8) such that their sum
will closely represent the desired loading. The sum of the
corresponding deflection functions (each of the form of eq. 10)
gives the desired solution. Details of this type of analysis are
to be found in reference 1 on pp. 113-176 and 199-256.
In common With all problems which are
formulated in terms of a partial differential


** the uniqueness of solutions to the differential equation of
the form of eq. (7) is a classical proof appearing in Ilumerous advanced texts on mathematics and mathematical
physics. Since the equation is known to have a unique
solution, then any solution found for it is the one and
only correct solution.

equation, the solution of the plate bending problem depends strongly upon the boundary conditions
(both the shape of the boundary and the types of
support provided there). The above example may
be said to have been deceptively easy because of
both the simple shape of the boundary and the
type of support. Plate problems wherein the
plate planform is not a simple geometric figure
must be solved by numerical means. As to the
type of support, a fUll discussion of boundary
conditions for plates is to be found in reference 1, pp. 89-95.


A17. 4 Compilations of Results for Plate Bending Problem s.

Fortunately for the practicing engineer, it
is not necessary to perform analytic computations
as discussed above for the great majority of
practical plate problems. Problems of the type
illustrated above, plus the myriad variations
possible, became very fashionable exercises
amongst mathematicians following the discovery
by LaGrange of eq. (7) in the year 1811. The
results of many researchers' labors have been
compiled in various forms for handy reference.
A com~on and important case is that of a
uniformly loaded rectangular plate (Fig. A17-4).
The major engineering results are the values of
the maximum deflections and the maximum stresses
developed. These may be put in the form (a is
the length of the short side):

                           - - (13)


where the coefficients _a_ and ~ are given in
Table A17.1 for the four most Common edge
conditions.

Similar presentations may be made for many
dozens of other cases. With the readyavailability of comprehensive catalogings of these
problems in references devoted to the purpose,
there appears to be little virtue in duplication
here. Hence the following list of selected
references is presented. Additional references
are to be found in turn within these works. We
note that, because of the linearity of the plate
bending problem, superposition of solutions is
possible to extend even further the usefulness
of these extensive listings.

A17.5 Deflection Limitations in Plate Analyses.
In the introductory remarks of this chapter it was stated that a plate may be distingUished from a membrane by the small order of
its deflections (on the order of a few tenths
of its thickness). We will re-examine this
statement here to show that this is not so
much a definition as it is an accuracy limitation imposed by one of the assumptions made in
the plate analysis.
There are several familiar assumptions
from beam theory which, of course, carryover
here, inasmuch as the plate analysis resembles
the beam analysis rather closely. These "beam
theory assumptions" are:

i-elastic stresses only are presumed,
ii   - small slopes (so that a [2] w/ax [2 ] and

a~/ay2 are good approximations to
the curvatures),

iii   - at least one transverse dimension
(length or width) be large compared to
the thickness so that shear deflections
may be neglected.


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-372-full.png)

However, the beam theory assumptions do not
place a very severe-restriction on the-magnitude
of defleCt1ons-permitted. Deflections of several times the plate thickness would be permissible if these were the only restricting
assumptions.
In deriving the plate bending equations it
was assumed that no stresses acted in the middle
(neutral) plane of the plate (no membrane
stresses). Thus, in summing forces to derive
eq. (6), no membrane stresses were present to
help support the lateral load. Now in the solutions to the great majority of all plate bending problems (solved as in Art. A17.3), the deflection surface solution found is a non-developable surface, i.e., a surface which cannot
be formed from a flat sheet without some streching of the sheets' middle surface*. But, if
appreciable middle surface strains must occur,
then large middle surface stresses will result,
invalidating the assumption upon which eq. (6)
was derived.
Thus, practically all loaded plates deform
into surfaces which induce some middle surface
stresses. It is the necessity for holding down
the magnitude of these very powerful middle
surface stretching forces that results in the
more severe rule-of-thumb restriction that plate
bending formulae apply accurately only to problems in which deflections are a few tenths of
the plates' thickness.

Fig. A17-5b shows the desired one-dimensional problem which now resembles a loaded
cable. The differential equation of equilibrium is obtained by summing vertical forces on

curvatures shown positive). One obtains

AI7.6 Membrane Action in Very Thin Plates.
There is still another source of middle W-2~\ (a-x)
surface strains in plates: this is the restraint against in-plane movements offered by The (as
the edge supports. While not important in problems wherein deflections are limited in accord- of the strip as
ance with the restriction of the last article, given by the
such restraint does assume great importance in length and the
the case of large deflections of very thin Thus:
plates which support a major share of the load
by membrane action. It is, in fact, useful to
consider the limiting case of the flat membrane
which cannot support any of the lateral load by
bending stresses and hence has to deflect and
stretch to develop both the necessary curvatures
and membrane stresses.
The two-dimensional membrane problem is a
nonlinear one whose solution has proven to be
very difficult. Rather than attempt to treat
the complete problem, we can study a simplified
version whose solution retains the desired
general features. The one-dimensional analysis
of a narrow (unit width) strip will be treated.

This strip is cut from an originally flat mem- Since the slope

The (as yet) unknown stress in eq. (15)
can be found by computing the change in length
of the strip as it deflects. This "stretch" is
given by the difference between the curved arc
length and the original straight length (a).

We note that the limiting case, alb = 0, corresponds to the one-dimensional case analyzed
earlier. Unfortunately, an extrapolation of
these two-dimensional results to that limit
does not show agreement with the one-dimensiDnal result. Presumably the discrepancy may
be traced to the excessive influence of inaccuracies in the assumed deflection shape of the
membrane as used in the approximate two-dimensional solutions.

A17.7 Large Deflections in Plates **.
In the previous articles of this chapter
the results of analyses were outlined for the
two extreme cases of sheet panels under lateral
loads. At one extreme, sheets whose bending
stiffness is great relative to the loads applied
(and which therefore deflect only slightly) may
be analyzed satisfactorily by the plate bending
solutions. At the other extreme, very thin
Sheets, under lateral loads great enough to
cause large deflections, may be treated as mem
branes whose bending stiffness is ignored.
As it happens, the most efficient plating
designs generally fall between these two extremes. On the one hand, if the designer is
to take advantage of the presence of the interior stiffening structure (rings, bulkheads,
stringers, etc.), Which is usually present for
other reasons anyway, then it is not necessary
to make the skin so heavy as to behave like a
"pure" plate. On the other hand, if the skin
is made so thin as to necessitate supporting
all pressure loads by stretching and developing
membrane stresses, then permanent deformation
results, producing "quilting" or "washboarding'
The exact analysis of the two-dimensional
plate which undergoes large deflections and
thereby supports the lateral loading partly by
its bending resistance and partly by membrane
action is very involved. A one-dimensional


** The discussion to follow will be concerned primarily with
problems dealing with the support of a uniform pressure
load on a flat skin panel. n may, therefore, help the
reader to fix his ideas if he visualizes the discussion as
applied to the problems of analysis of a single rectangular
skin panel taken between the stringers and bulkheads of a
seaplane hull bottom. Equally useful is the picture of the
very nearly flat panel between rings and stringers in the
slightly curved side of a large pressurized fuselage.



Equations (16) and (17) display the essential nonlinearity of the problem, the stress and
the deflection both varying as fractional exponents of the lateral pressure q.

nonlinear membrane problem have been carried

be found in reference 1, pp. 4-10. A more
elaborate two-dimensional analysis is shown on
pp. 347-350 of this same reference.
An approximate solution of the large deflection plate problem can be obtained by adding
together the flat plate and membrane solutions
in the following way:
Solve eq. (12), the plate bending relation,
for q; call it q',


q' = wMAX E t"

Now solve eq. (18), the membrane relation, for
q; call it q",

Eq. (20), we see, is based upon summing the individual stiffnesses of the two extreme behavior mechanisms by which a flat sheet can
support a lateral load. No interaction between
stress systems is assumed and, since the system
is nonlinear, the result can be an approximation
only.

square plate using values of _a_ and n 1 as taken
from Tables A17.1 and A17.2. Also plotted are
the results of an exact analysis (reference 5).
As may be seen, eq. (21) is somewhat conservative inasmuch as it gives a deflection which is
too large for a given pressure.

as the prediction of stresses is concerned.
For simply supported edges the maximum combined

_A17.8_ Considerations in the Applications of Large-Deflection Plate and Membrane Analyses.
Before concluding this chapter it is
pertinent to note several serious omissions in
the developments outlined above with regard to
their application to flat pressure-panel
analyses within a ship hull or fuselage. The

stresses at the center of a square panel whereas n2 =

**A17.8** **BENDING OF** **PLATES**



large-deflection plate and the membrClne analyses
were developed for applications where the plate
bending analysis appeared inadequate. However,
these analyses themselves presumed conditions
seldom encountered in practice.
FIRST, the analyses assume unyielding supports on the boundaries of the sheet panel. In
practice, the skin is stretched across an elastic framework of stringers aml bulkheads. It
follows, therefore, that the heavy membrane
tensile forces developed during large deflections will cause the supports to deflect towards
each other thereby increasing the plate deflection and relieving some of the stresses.
A simple one-dimensional analysis for a
membrane strip having elastic edge supports
(parallel to the analysis of Art. AI7.6), shows
errors on the order of 25 per cent are likely if
the framework elasticity is neglected (reference
7). At this writing no two-dimensional treatment of this problem is known to the writer.
SECOND, it is seldom that the analyst has
to check a panel for lateral pressure loads
alone. Most often, the entire "field" of panels
on the framework of stringers and bulkheads must
simultaneously transmit in-plane loadings from
the tail load bending stresses and the cabin
pressurization stresses.
Inasmuch as the large-deflection plate and
membrane analyses are nonlinear, it follows that
correct stresses cannot be found by a straight
superposition. The magnitude of the error introduced by such a procedure is difficult to
estimate in the absence of an exact analysis. A
one-dimensional analysis, parallel to that of
Art. A17.6, but with elastic supports and axial
load, is given in reference 7. These reSUlts,
which indicate the effect of the axial load to
be qUite importClnt, may be used as a guide in
lieu of more complete two-dimensional studies.
The interested reader is referred to the original work for details.

**PART I**

**ELASTIC** **AND** **INELASTIC INSTABILITY** **OF** **COLUMNS**



A18. I Introduction.


Part 1 of this chapter will be confined
to the theoretical treatment of the instability
of a perfect elastic column and an imperfect
elastic column. The column is the simplest of
the various types of structural elements that
are sUbject to the phenomenon of instability.
The theory as deYeloped for columns forms the
basis for the study of the instability of thin
plates, which subject is treated in Part 2.


A18.2 Combined Bending and Compression of Columns.


Consider a column with one end simply
supported and the other end hinged (Fig. A18.1)
under the simultaneous action of a compressive
load P and a transverse load Q. Without the
load P the bending moment due to Q would be:

On the upper portion


11], = Q(l-a)(l-z)      -      -      -      -      -      -      -      -      
], 1 (b)


Due to the deflection u(z), the axial
load P contributes to the bending moment by
the amount:

(c)



Thus the total bending moment at section z
will be:

11 = Pu + --1- Qaz on upper portion     - - - - (d)


11 = PU + Q(l-a) (l-z) on lower portion (e)

From mechanics of simple bending, we have
the deflection equation,


d [2] u 11

          -          - -          - [- -] [ -]          -          -          - (1)
dz [2] [ =] [ -] Ely


Thus the deflection u(z) of the column
is,

The general solution of eq. (2) is:

where C]" C2, C 3, and C 4 are constants of
integration to be determined from boundary
conditions.


For eqs. (4), since u = 0 for z = 0 and
z ; 1, it follows that:


C], = 0 and C 3 =- C 4 tan Kl - - - - - (f)


At z = (1 - a) the two portions of the
deflection curve given by (4a) and (4b)
respectively must have the same deflection and
slope. From these two conditions we determine
C2 and C 4

the body would cause only infinitesimal changes
in the displacements and the body recovers if
the added loads are removed. When the displacements are continuously increased with
little or no further increment of loads, the
system is unstable. If the body will remain
in the displaced position after the removal
of the disturbance, the body is said to be in
neutral equilibrium. Having these definitions,
we will not investigate the behavior of the
column before and after the critical load is
reached.

Assu~e, as shown in Fig. A18.2, that a

Equation (7) is an important equation
derived first by Euler. It gives the critical
compressive load which causes infinite deflection in a column and it specifies the ultimate
strength of a column in compression.


It is obvious-from eq. (7) that EUler's
critical load is independent of the magnitude
of the transverse load Q. It seems, therefore,
that even in the absence of the transverse
load Q, the maximum deflection becomes infinite
under the action of only a compressive load as
given by eq. (7).


A18. 3 Elastic Stability of a Column.


The above conclusion as to the critical
load was based on purely mathematical reasoning.
We have found a critical value of a compressive
load which causes infinite deflection.


Far more important, however, is an investigation of the stability of a column which
should be based on physical arguments. The
question arises as to what happens before the
load P reaches its critical value as given
by eq. (7) and also how the column behaves if
this critical value is exceeded.

Let us now examine the stability of
various equilibrium configurations. Assume
that a load pJ. is acting on the column and
the column has a certain maximum deflection 5
where pJ. does not correspond to 5.


The non-dimensional maximum bending
moment is:

J. pJ. 5
m = -(-) P cr 1  - - (8g)


The mJ. versus 5/1 curves are straight lines.
The column is in eqUilibrium if m = mJ., or in
other words, if the mJ.(5/1) curve intersects
the m(5/1) curve.


We see from Fig. A18.3 that these curves
intersect at the origin only if P J. <: P cr . The
column, therefore, has only one possible
eqUilibrium form, for example, that for which
5/1 - 0, Which is the straight form. When
pJ. - Pcr, there are two points of intersection,


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-379-full.png)

A18.4 THEORY OF THE INSTABILITY OF COLUMNS AND THIN SHEETS



one when 0/1 = 0 and the other (point A) for
which 0/1 ~ O. The column thus has two
possible equilibrium forms, one straight and
one bent.


Let us now assume that at 0 = 0, the
column is displaced by a small disturbance
and acquires a deflection 0:1.' For p:I. -< P cr,
we see from Fig. 3 that m> m:l.. Thus p:I. is
not sufficient to maintain the column in
equilibrium in the bent form and it will spring
back to its straight form. Thus for p:I. c: P cr,
the straight form is stable.


If p:I.    - P cr, then m:l.    - m. Thus m:l. will
bend the column still further. This means
that if p:I. - P cr, the straight form of
equilibrium is unstable. The column will
continue to bend until m:l. becomes equal to m
(point A in Fig. 3). If the column is displaced further from A, the deflection becomes
larger than O 2 and m ~m:l. at the new position.
The column will spring back to point A. Point
A is therefore stable.


At P = P cr, the m:l. versus 0/1 line is
tangent to the m curve at the origin. Therefore, for an infinitesimal disturbance, the
column will remain in equilibrium at the
displaced position since for such small
disturbances m:l. remains equal to m. The column
is therefore in neutral equilibrium.


A18.4 The Failure of Columns by Compression.


In discussing the stability of a column
in the previous section, it was shown that
below the critical Euler load (Eq. 7), the
straight form is stable, above the P cr the
bent form is stable and at P cr the equilibrium
is neutral. By plotting the curve p/p cr versus
0/1 as shown in Fig. A18.4, we observe the
following behavior.


(a) Below P/P cr = 1, there is only one
equilibrium position, 0/1 = O.


piper



(b) At P/P cr = 1, or at point (A), a bifurcation
of equilibrium occurs and the column starts
to acquire two possible neighbor positions
of equilibrium, the straight and the bent.


(c) Above P/Pcr = 1, the column has two possible
equilibrium positions 0/1 = 0 and 0:1./1 ~ O.


Thus as far as initiation of instability is
concerned, the Euler load as given by Eq. 7 can
be considered as the critical load. The question
arises whether this load has a practical use
for design purposes. A logical design criterion
is obviously the maximum load which a column can
sustain. We observe from Fig. A18.4 that the
load P increases for increasing displacement o.
This behavior is due to the development of large
deflections due to bending. However, over a
considerable range of deflections 0, the P -+ 0
curve is practically horizontal (for instance,
between points A and B the ratio 0/1 varies
from zero to ~ 0.4). For such large deflections
for which the column load does not change
practically, it is obvious that the column
ceases to function properly. Therefore, from
this point of view, the Euler load can be considered that which characterizes the maximum
strength of the column.


The rising part of the curve BD holds as
long as the material behaves elastically. At
some point B, however, inside the almost flat
portion of the curve, the inner fibers of the
column acquire maximum stress equal to the
yield stress. If we carry out an elasticplastic analysis of the subsequent behavior,
we observe that the curve drops almost
immediately. Again this maximum load PB is
very near the Euler load. For design purposes,
therefore, the Euler load, which is a buckling
load, is a very good approximation to the
Ultimate load which the column can sustain.


Another argument will confirm the above
conclusion. In discussing the buckling of
columns in the previous paragraphs, we have
assumed that the column is initially straight,
centrally loaded and made of
homogeneous material. Actual
columns, however, are imperfect
due to initial crookedness (for
instance, due to unavoidable
tolerances in their manufacture),
due to slight load eccentricities
and due to lack of complete
homogenity. Therefore, a certain
amount of bending is always

u present even for small loads.

Fig.
A18.5



Let us now examine the
behavior of such initially imperfect columns by assuming a
certain initial deflection 11"
of the column axis (see Fig.
A18.5). For small deflections,


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-380-full.png)

the change of curvature due to sUbsequent
bending (after loading) is:

° 2
(l) = ~ _ d l};o

R dz dZ


In the differential equation of deflection
one can prove that llR is the change of
curvature which for an initial straight column
coincides with the curvature itself. Thus in
the present case, where the bending moment is
Pu, the equation of deflection becomes:

Let us express Uo in Fournier series:

                 - - - - -(10)


Substituting (10) in (9), we find the
solution which satisfies the boundary
conditions (u = 0 for z 0, Z = 1) is:

The deflection of the column at the center
is:

                    - -(12)


If we plot the deflection versus the load
we obtain the curve (Fig. A18.6), which



**A18.5**


approaches the horizontal line _PIPer_ = 1
asymptotically. This curve, however, is valid
for small deflections for which the approximation:

is valid.


By a treatment similar to that in the
previous paragraph, we will find that for
large deflections the load deflection curve
raises after the point I (curve FIH). Due to
the onset of plasticity, the actual curve
drops at the point 11. (curve FII1.H1.). The
failing load at 11. can be either greater or
smaller than Per, but it is usually very near
to it.


In the above discussions we have shown
that for all practical purposes the Euler
buckling load can be considered as the ultimate load which a real or practical column
can sustain. Besides its closeness to the
actual ultimate load, the critical load can
be easily calculated from equation (7) without the necessity of carrying out a lengthy
calculation which will include the initial
imperfections and plastic effects.


It should be noted, however, that the
buckling load given by equation (7) is valid
when the uniform stress due to a compressive
load (0 = _PIA,_ where A is cross-sectional
area) is below yield stress. If 0 is above
the yield stress, the theory of plasticity
predicts another value for the buckling load.
Referring now to equations (11) we find:

Since E is a function of ocr given by eq. (28)
and the value of Et at the unknown ocr, the
calculation of the critical stress requires a
trial and error simultaneous solution of
equations (23), (26) and (28).


**Al8.8** **Imperfect** **Column.** **Tangent-Modulus** **Theory.**


The tangent-modulus theory, originally
proposed by Engesser (Ref. 1), is based on the
assumption that at the critical state, no
stress reversal takes place, and the critical
stress, therefore, is determined only by the
tangent modulus Et. This theory was abandoned
early since according to the previous discussion with the classical definition of
instability (perfect column, bifurcation of
equilibrium) strain reversal does take place.
In recent years, however, this tangent modulus
theory has been proved useful.


Under the assumption of no strain reversal
both sides of the cross-section in Fig. A18.8a,
will be characterized by the same linear stress
distribution, corresponding to the tangentmodulus Et. Thus the buckling equation will be,


               - - - - - - - (29)

To resolve this controversy, Shanley
(Ref. 2), proposed the following explanation.

column be formed by two rigid legs (see Fig.

hinge. Assume that this column starts to
buckle as soon as at is reached. By consider

that while the strain on the concave side

value at the reduced-modulus load, the strain
on the convex side decreases initially very
slowly. Due to this picture we can conceive
that in a real column, which has initial imperfections, the compressive strain will
increase more rapidly. Furthermore, the
rapid increase of OE 1 will cause a fast reduction of Et. The column, therefore, loses
its usefulness after the tangent-modulus has
been slightly increased. Thus the tangent

A18.10 THEORY OF THE INSTABILITY OF COLUMNS AND THIN SHEETS


**PART** **2**


**THEORY** **OF** **THE** **ELASTIC** **INSTABILITY** **OF** **THIN** **SHEETS**



A18.9 Introduction.


Thin sheets represent a very common and
important structural element in aerospace
structures since the major - units of such
structures are covered with thin sheet panels.
Since compressive stresses cannot be eliminated
in aerospace structures, it is important to
know what stress intensities will cause thin
sheet panels to buckle. Equations for the
buckling of thin sheet panels under various
load systems and boundary conditions have
been derived many years ago and are readily
available to design engineers. Part C of this
book takes up the use of the many buckling
equations in the practical design of thin
sheet structural elements. The purpose of
this chapter is to introduce the student to
the theory of thin plate instability or how
these buckling equations so widely in use by
design engineers were derived. For a broad
comprehensive treatment of the sUbject of
instability of structural elements, the student
should refer to some of the references as
listed at the end of this chapter.


A18.10 Pure Bending of Thin Plates.


To derive the theory of instability of
thin plates, we must first derive the theory
of the pure bending of thin plates.



curvature of the middle surface can be found


aw aw
apprOXimately by omitting powers of ax ' ay,

as compared to unity, as it has been done for
the curvature of beams. Thus the curvature
of the deflected middle surface in planes
parallel to xz and yz planes respectively are:



1
R
y



(la)



Another quantity used in the problem of plates
is the so-called twist of the middle surface
given by:


(lb)


The strains can now be expressed by means of
curvatures and twist of the middle surface.
In the case of pure bending of prismatic bar
a rigorous solution was obtained by assuming
that cross-sections of the bars remain plane
after bending and rotate so as to remain
perpendicular to the deflected neutral axis.
Combination of such bending in two perpendicular directions brings us to pure bending
of plates.



In the following the analysis will be
confined to small deformations. Let x, y be
the middle plane of the plate before bending
occurs and Z be the axis normal to that plane.
Points of the x,

~------~x y plane undergo

small displacements, w in the
z-direction,
which will be
referred as the

y deflection of

the plate. The

they produce compression in the upper surface Since we treat the problem of plates as a plane
of the plate and tension in the lower. Let stress problem, we find by means of Hook's law

out of the plate with sides dx, dy, t. The
thickness t is considered very small compared
with the other dimensions. Obviously the
stress conditions at the edges of all such - - - - - - elements will be identical to that of Fig. 2a. (4a)
Assume now that the lateral sides of the
element remain plane during bending and rotate = Ez (1 _lI)=_

the middle surface does not undergo any
extension and it is therefore the neutral - - - - - - - (4b)
surface.
These normal stresses are linearly distributed

From the geometry of the above described over the plate thickness. Their reSUltants

From the geometry of the above described

A point B on the middle surface has been
displaced to B~ by W in the z-direction. An
element of surface dzdy has rotated by an
angle equal to the slope of the deflected
middle surface in the direction so as to
remain normal to the middle surface. See
Fig. 3.

A18.12 THEORY OF THE INSTABILITY OF COLUMNS AND THIN SHEETS



A18. 11 The Differential Equation of the Deflection Surface.


To develop the theory of small deflections
of thin plates we make one more assumption.
At the boundary of the plate we assume that
its edges are free to move in the plane of the
plate.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-387-0.png)


Fig. 4


Thus the reactive forces at the edges due to
the supports are normal to the plate. With
these assumptions we can neglect any strain
in the middle plane during bending.


Let us consider, Fig.4, an element dxdy
of the middle plane. Along its edge the
moments Mx, My, Mxy are distributed. These
are the resultants of the bending and twisting
stresses distributed linearly along the
thickness of the plate (see eqs. 4 and 5).
If the plate is loaded by external forces
normal to the middle plane in addition to the
above moments there are vertical shearing
forces Qx, Qy, acting on the sides of the
element of Fig. 4.


"x ~ = _Jh/2_ oxzdr, Qy = _Jh/2_ oyzdz -- ( ) 6
-h/2 -h/2


Let q be the transverse load per unit area
acting normally to the upper face of the
plate. Considering the force equilibrium in
the z-direction of the element of Fig. 4 we
find:


aQ,x aQy
-- dxdy + -- dydx + qdxdy = 0 or =
ax ay


aQ x aQy
-- + - + q = 0     -     -     -     -     - (6a)
ax ay


Taking the equilibrium of the moments acting
in the X-direction we obtain:



The above analysis is sufficient to seek
solutions of specific problems. The general
procedure is to find approximate solution of
the fourth order differential equation (8)
which satisfies the given boundary displacement
and force conditions.


A18. 12 Strain Energy in Pure Bending of Plates.


In evaluating the strain energy of a thin
plate we shall ignore the contribution of the
shear strains which are generally small for
small deflections.



aMxy aMy
ax dxdy - ay dxdy + Qy dxdy = 0


aM xy aMy
ax -ay-+ Qy = 0



or


 - - - (6b)



From the moment equilibrium in the y-direction
we find:


aM xy aM x
--+---Qx=O --------(6c)
ay ax


By eliminating Qx, Qy from 6 a,b,c, we find
the equilibrium relation between the moments:


(7 )


To represent this equation in terms of the
deflections w of the plate, we make the
assumption that the expression (5) derived for
pure bending holds approximately also in the
case of laterally loaded plates. This
assumption is equivalent to neglecting the
effect on bending of the shearing forces and
the compressive stress Oz. This is an extension of the engineering theory of bending
of beams. As in the case of beams it gives
good approximation for bending of plates under
transverse loads.


Introducing equation (4) into (7) we find:



a [4] w a [4] w

--+ --+
ax [4] ay 4



(8)



The problem of bending of plates is thus
reduced to integrating eq. (8) for w. The
corresponding shearing forces in terms of the
displacements are found from eqs. 4 and 6b
and c:

Fig. 5b


The strain energy stored in a plate
element is obtained by calculating the work
done by the moments Mxdy, and Mydx on the
element during bending. Since the sides of
the element remain plane during bending the
work done by Mxdy is obtained by taking half
the product of Mxdy and the relative angle
of rotation of the two sides of the element.
Since the curvature in the x-direction is



a"w

- ax",

sides 1



the relative angle of rotation of the

a"w
and 2 of distance dx will be - ax" dx.



Thus the work due to MxdY is:


1 a"w

                                -                                -                                -                                dV x = - 2" Mx ax" dxdy (a)


Similarly the work due to Mydx is:



1 a"w
dV y =- 2" My ax" dxdy

This expression will be modified later when we
will consider the superposition of compressive
loads in the plane of the plate which are
related to the problem of plate buckling.


A18. 13 Bending of Rectangular Plates.


The general differential equation for
bending plates was given in section C2.3
(eq. 8). Two very useful methods of solution
have been widely used, namely, the Fourier
Series Method and the Energy Method. Both
methods will be developed in the following
for rectangular plates and various edgesupporting conditions. The edge support
conditions are classified as follows:


a) BUilt-in edge or Fixed: The deflection
along the bUilt-in side is zero and the tangent
plane to the deflected middle surface is
horizontal. Thus if for instance the x-axis
coincides with the bUilt-in edge these conditions are:


(w)y = 0 = 0 = 0    - - - -(12a)


b) Simply supported edge: The deflection
along the simply-supported side is zero and the
bending moment parallel to this side is also
zero. Thus if the plate is simply supported
along the x-axis we have:



The tWisting moment MxydY also does work
against rotation of the element about the
x-axis. The relative angle of rotation of the



a"w
two sections 1, 2 is obviously axay dx. 'rhUS

the work done by MxydY is:



1 a"w
dV xy = "2 Mxy axay dxdy


and the work due to Myxdx = Mxydx is:



(w) _ =0
y-o

- (c)



1 a"w
dVyx = 2" Mxy axay dxdy   -   - - (d)


(It is noted that the twist does not affect
the work produced by the bending moments,
neither the bending affect the work produced
by the torsional moments).


Thus the total strain energy per unit
volume of the plate is:



c) Free edge: The bending moment,
tWisting moment and shear force along the free
side is zero. Thus if the free side coincides
With the straight line x = aL we have:


(Q,x) = 0

x=a


However, as was proved by Ki rchoff two bourldary
conditions are only necessary to find a unique
solution of the bending problem. He has shown
that the two last equations of the above
conditions can be replaced by one condition.

Expressing the condition (Mx)x=a = 0 in terms

of w we find the final form of the boundary
conditions along the free edge:


(12c)


In the following solutions for various
edge conditions will be developed.


1. Simply supported rectangular plates


Let a plate with sides a and b and axes
x, y, as shown in Fig. 6, be simply supported
around the whole periphery and loaded by a
distributed load q = f (x,y).


Two methods of solutions will be
developed:


a) Navier solution by means of double
Fourier Series:


We can always express f (x,y) in the form
of a double trigonometric (Fourier) series:


00 00
q = f(x,y) = Z Z a mn sin m~ sin n~y -(13a)

plate this approximation becomes:


which is by 2-1/2% is error with the exact

The expressions for bending and tWisting
moments are not so qUickly convergent. To
improve the solution another series solution
can be developed as follows:

The method will be developed for uniform

the form:

where Y m is a function of y only. Each term
of the series satisfies the boundary conditions
a 2 w
w = 0, ax 2 = Oat x = a. It remains to

determine Y m so as to satisfy the remaining

two boundary,conditions w = 0, ~;: = ° at y = b.


A further simplification can be made if
we take the solution in the form



Y m () y = ---D qa 4 [A m cos h mny a + Em mny a sin h mny a


+ em s ni h ---a- [mny] + T\..._ ~Ill mny -a- cos -a h mnYJ


-(20)


Since the deflection is s~~etric with
**respect** **to** **the** **x-axis** **it** **follows** **that** **em** **=**
Dm = 0. Thus:



w = w~ + W 2   - - - - - (17a)

is the deflection of a very long strip with
the long side in the x-direction loaded by a
uniform load q 0 supported at the short sides
x = 0, x = a, and free at the two long sides.
Since (17b) satisfies the differential
equation and the boundary conditions at x = 0,
x = a, the problem is solved if we find the
solution of:


(18 )

eqUilibrium in the x, y-directions are given
byeq. (28). Consider now the projection of

On the other hand if the plate is loaded by
transverse loads the stresses give rise to
pure bending and twisting moments only. The
equations of equilibrium for the latter have
been given in before (see eqs. 6, 7, 8). If
both transverse loads and coplanar edge loadS
are acting simultaneously, then for small
vertical deflections the state of stress is
the superposition of the stresses due to
Nx ' Ny, N xy and Mx ' My, M XY . For large
vertical deflection of the plate, however,
there is interaction of the coplanar stresses
and the deflections. These stresses give rise
to additional bending moments due to the nonzero lever arm of the edge loads from the
deflected middle surface, as in the case of
beams. When the edge loads are compressive
this additional moments might cause instability
and failure of the plate due to excessive
vertical deflections.


In this chapter the problem of instability
of plates will be examined.


When the edge loads are compressive and
give rise to additional bending moments eq. (8)
must be modified.

Eq. (29) replaces eq. (6a) when edge loads are

valid since they express moment equilibrium
of the element dxdy in which the contribution
of Nx, Ny, Nxy is zero. Thus eliminating Q x,

During bending due to transverse loads
or/and due to buckling we assume that the edge
loads and consequently Nx, Ny, Nxy, remain
constant. Its variation is thus zero and we
do not consider it in the following. Let us
apply now the transverse load that produces
bending. (We can also consider bending due to
other transverse disturbance, which is the
case of buckling). If u, v, are the displacements of the middle surface due to the coplanar
loads (which are assumed constant across the
thickness) and w the bending deflection of the
plate it can be shown that the strains are:

The distribution of the coplanar stresses
Nx, Ny, Nxy can be found from eqs. (28) by
solving the plane stress problem. In the
following the above theory will be applied to
rectangular plates.


**A18.15** Strain Energy of Plates Due to Edge

The energy expression for pure bending,

Here u, v are the additional coplanar displacements after bending has started. It can be
shown by integrating by parts that the first
integral is the work done during bending by the
edge loads. For instance taking a rect~ngular

A18.20 THEORY OF THE INSTABILITY OF COLUMNS AND THIN SHEETS



Obviously the first two integrals represent
the work done by the edge loads while the
second integral is zero due to the equilibrium
equations (28). Thus the work of the edge
loads is:


We assume now that for small deflections
the stretching of the middle surface of the
plate is negligible. (This is the so-called
inextensional theory of plates). In this case
by zeroing the strains in eq. (b) and substituting in (f) we find:


(32a)


In the strain energy expression, eq. (a)
the first two terms cancel each other and the
strain energy is due only to bending:

Expressions (32b) and (c) will be used in
solving the buckling problem by means of the
principle of virtual work.


A18. 16 Buckling of Rectangular Plates with Various Edge
Loads and Support Conditions.


General discussion


In calculating critical values of edge
loads for which the flat form of equilibrium
becomes unstable and the plate begins to
buckle, the same methods and corresponding
reasonings as for compressed bars will be
employed.


The critical values can be obtained by
assuming that the plate has a slight initial
curvature or a small transverse load. These
values of the edge loads for which the lateral
deflection w becomes infinite are the critical
values (see Part 1 for similar treatment in
columns) .


Another way of investigating such
instability is to assume that the plate buckles
due to a certain external disturbance and then
to calculate the edge loads for which such a



buckled configuration (deflections different
from zero) is possible. It was found in the
case of column that this latter solution
(Euler's solution) approaches asymptotically
the first at the limit where the deflections
become extremely large but for even small
deflections the edge load acquires a value
very near the Euler's critical value. The
latter technique is mathematically more
convenient and it gives for plates also a very
good estimate of their compressive strength.
In the following we shall use this latter
approach by assuming a plate with edge loads
and no transverse load. Eq. (30) becomes in
this case:


(33)


By solving eq. (33) we will find that the
assumed buckling made is possible (w 1 0) for
certain definite values of the edge loads, the
smallest of which determines the critical load.
The energy method can also be used in investigating buckling problems. In this method we
assume that the plate is initially under the
plane stress conditions due to the edge loads
and the stress distribution is assumed as known.
We then consider the buckled state as a possible
configuration of equilibrium. The change of the
work is given by eq. (32a). We interpret here
w as a virtual displacement though we do not use
the variation symbol o. Thus the increment of
work oW is given by (32a) and the increment of
strain energy oVi is given by eq. (32b). If
OW<oVi for every possible shape of buckling the
flat equilibrium is stable. If OW>oVi for a
certain shape of buckling then the flat configuration is unstable and the plate will buckle
under any load above the critical load. If
oW = oV i, the equilibrium is neutral and from
this equation we find the critical load. The
critical load therefore is found from the
equation:


- 2: 1 ! ! [ Nx (ax) aw" + Ny (ay) aw " + 2N xy ax . aw ay aw] dxdy =

~ !!{(a"w + a"w)" _ 2(1-))) [a [2] w . a"w _ ( a"w )2l}dXd
2 ax" ay2 ax" ay2 axay J y


                                    -                                    (34)


Here w is a certain assumed deflection which
satisfies the boundary conditions (Virtual
deflection) .


A18.l7 Buckling of Simply Supported Rectangular Plates
Uniformly Compressed in One Direction.


Let a plate of sides a and b (Fig. 11)
simply supported around its periphery be compressed by load Nx uniformly distributed
along the sides x = 0 and x = a. From the

obvious solution of the corresponding plane
stress problem we find that the state of
stress is everywhere a simple compression
equal to Nx (the load at the periphery).


The deflection surface of a simply
supported plate when bending takes place have
been found previously (see eq. 14a). Its
general expression can be written in a double
series form:

W = Z
m=l

b + d + f +


This fraction has some intermediate value
between the maximum and the minimu~ of the
fractions (a). It follows that if we wish to
make the fraction (b), which is similar to the
fraction of eq. 35d, a minimum, we must take
only one term in the numerator and the corresponding term in the denominator. Thus to make
the fraction of eq. (35d) minimum, we must put
all the parameters C u, CJ.2, C 2 J. - ••• except
one, zero. This is equivalent to assuming that
the buckling configuration is of simple
sinusoidal form in both directions, i.e.

mnx nny
W mn = Cmn sin -a- - sin -b-' The minimum

expression for C mn obtained by dropping all the
terms except C rnn becomes:


                      - - (3.5e)


It is obvious that the smallest value of Nx is
obtained by taking n = 1. This means that the
plate buckles always in such a way that there
can be several half-waves in the direction of
compression but only are half-wave in the
perpendicular direction. Thus for n = 1, eq.
(35e) becomes:


The value of m (in other words the number of
half-waves) which makes this critical value
the smallest possible depends on the ratio
alb and can be found as follows:


Let us express (36a) in the form:


                               (36b)


where k is a numerical factor depending on (t)' a
From (36a) and (36b) we have:


k = ~ (m + 1:.. ~)2 (36c)
a [2] m b [2]


a
If we plot k against b for various values of the

integer ill = 1,2,3, **.....** we obtain the curves
of Fig. (12). From these curves the critical
load factor k and the corresponding number of
half-waves can readily be determined. It is
only necessary to take the corresponding point

a
(j)) as the axis of abcissas and to choose that


curve which gives the smallest k. In Fig. 12
the portion of the various curves which give
the critical values of k are shown by fUll
lines. The transition from m to (m + 1) halfwaves occurs at the intersection of the two
corresponding lines. From eq. (36c) we find:



The increment of strain energy found by
substituting (35a) in the right-hand side of
(34) is:


2
7 (' ~rnn 2 (m a [2] + ~)2 b2 (35b)
n=l


The increment of work done by the external
forces is found by sUbstituting (35a) into the
left-hand side of eq. (34) and Nx = const,
Nx = Nxy = O. Thus:


OW=l.N 1 [a] 1 [b] [ (aw)'"dxd] =
2. x 0 0 ax y

-sa n 2 b [Nx] [ z] 00 00 Z m 2 C rnn 2  - - - - - - (35c)

From the equality oW = OVi, solving for Nx, we
obtain:

m=l n=l
Nx = 00 00 - - - (35d)
z Z m [2] C rnn 2
m=l n=l


Here C mn is arbitrary. We are interested,
however, to find that values of C mn which make
Nx minimum. To that effect we use the following mathematical reasoning:


Imagine a series of fractions:


ace

                           -                           -                           -                           -                           -                           -                           b'd'f'· ....  - .. (a)


If we add the numerators and the denominators
we obtain the fraction:

A18. 19 Buckling of Simply Supported Rectangular Plate
Under Combined Bending and Compression.


Let us consider a simply supported
rectangular plate (Fig. 15). Along the sides
x = 0, x = a there are linearly distributed
edge loads given by the equation:


Nx = No (1 - A ~)   - - - - - - - - - (39a)


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-398-full.png)

which is a combination of pure bending and
pure compression. Let us take the deflection
again in the form:

we obtain from (39f):

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-398-1.png)


These are homogeneous equations in a 11, a 12 **'"**
etc. The system possesses a non-zero solution
(which indicates the possibility of buckling of
the plate) if the determinant of eq. (39h) is
zero. From this condition an equation is
obtained for ocr' ObViously the system (39h)
is of infinite number of equations (n = 1, 2,
3 ... ). A sufficient approximation is
obtained by taking a large but finite number
of terms and find the solution of the finite
determinant (USing for example digital
computers). Thus a curve of ocr versus alb is
obtained for m = 1 like that of Fig. 12.
Repeating the same calculation for m = 2, 3
etc., we find similar curves of two, three, etc.
half-wave lengths. The regions of the curves
with minimum ordinates define the region of
stability as in Fig. (12).


A18.20 Inelastic Buckling of Thin Sheets


The problem of the inelastic buckling of
thin sheets has been extensively studied by
various authors. The main difficulty in such
studies is in reference to the stress-strain
relations of plasticity under complex states
of stress. Many controversial discussions
have appeared in literature without resolving
the theoretical difficulties. For this reason
we will not develop the theory of inelastic
buckling in this chapter. Some of the better
references on this sUbject are listed below.


Chapter C4 presents the plasticity
correction factors to use in calculating the
inelastic buckling strength of thin sheets.

(BY PROFESSOR E. F. BRUHN)



A18.22 Methods of Column Failure. Column Equations.


In Part 1, the theory of the elastic and
inelastic instability of the column was presented. The equations from Part 1 for a pin
end support condition are:

For elastic primary failure,



n"E
F c = --(Lip )"




- - - - - - - - - (1)



For inelastic primary failure,



n"Et

F c =

(Lip )"



- - - - - - - (2)



Where Fc = compressive unit stress at
failure = _piA_ stress.


E = Young's modulus


Et = tangent modulus


L = column length

p = radius of gyration of crosssection


Fig. 16 shows a typical plot of Fc versus
Lip. If the column dimensions are such as to
cause it to fail in range CD in Fig. 16, the
primary failure is due to elastic instability
and equation (1) holds. This range of Lip
values is often referred to by engineers as the
long column range.



The range AB in Fig. 16 is for a range
of Lip values of below 20 to 25, and represents a range where failure is due to plastic
crushing of the column. In other words, the
column is too short to buckle or bow under
end load but crushes under the high stresses.
This column range of stresses is usually
referred to as the block compression strength.


A column, however, may fail by local
buckling or crippling due to distortion of
the column cross-section in its own plane.
The horizontal dashed line in Fig. 16
represents the condition where the primary
column strength is limited by the local weakness. This line moves up or down according
to the value of the local weakness. The
determination of the column strength when
failure is due to local weakness is covered

in volume 2.


A18.23 Column End Restraint. Fixity Coefficients.
Column Effective Length.


The column strength is influenced by the
end support restraint against rotation and by
any lateral supports between the column ends.
The letter c is commonly used to indicate the
end fixity coefficient, and C = 1.0 for zero
end restraint against rotation, which can be
produced mechanically by a pin or ball and
socket end support fitting. Thus including
the end restraint effect equations (1) and (2)
can be written,


F c = cn"E, F c = cn"Et   -   -   -   -   - (3)

Local Crippling Limit Let.L' = effective length of the column
which equals the length between inflection
points of the deflected column under load.


Then L' = _Live_ (4 )


Thus equation (3) can be written as,
~~o~~ L'/p

The range BC represents the range of L~
values where failure is due to inelastic instability of the column as a whole and equation
(2) applies. This range BC is often referred
to as the short column range.



If we let P = failing or critical load,
equation (5) can be written as equation (6)
by realizing that P = FcA and p = _**vIlA.**_

A18.24 Design Column Curves for Various Materials.


For routine design purposes it is convenient to have column curves of allowable
failing column stress Fc versus the effective
slenderness ratio L' /p. In equation (5) we
will assume values of Fc, then find the
tangent modulus Et corresponding to this
stress and then solve for the term L' /p.
Table A18.1 shows the calculations for
17.7 PH (THI050) stainless steel sheet at
room temperature. The results are then plotted
in Fig. 18 to give the column strength curve.
Similar data was calculated for the material
under certain exposure time to different
elevated temperatures and the results are also
plotted in Fig. 18. Figs. 19 to 22 give
column curves for other materials under various
temperature conditions.


A18.25 Selection of Materials for Elevated Temperature
Conditions.


Light weight is an important requirement
in aerospace structural design. For columns
that fail in the inelastic range of stresses,
a comparison of the FCY/W ratio of materials
gives a fairly good picture of the efficiency
of compression members when sUbjected to
elevated temperature conditions. In this
ratio Fcy is the yield stress at the particular
temperature and w is the weight per cu. inch
of the material. Fig. 23 shows a plot of
Fc /w for temperature ranges up to 600 [0] F.

Solution:


Since the column may fail by bending about
either the X or Y axes, the column strength for
bending about each of these axes will be calculated. Since the column strength is a function
of the radius of gyration of the cross-section,
the first step in the solution will be the calculation of Ix and Iy, from which p x and Py can
be found.


Calculating Ix: In Fig. 25 the section will
be first considered a solid rectangle 2.5 x
2.75 and then the properties of portions (1)
and (2) will be sUbtracted.


Ix (rectangle) = l~ x 2.5 X 2.75 3 = 4.32

negligible)

Portion (2) = -(.25x .625x .833 2 )4-4(.25X

Iy = 3.58 - 1.52 - .488 = 1.58 in. [4]


Py = _J_ 1.58/4.375 = .60"


Column strength is considerably influenced
by the end restraint conditions. For failure
by bending about the x-x axis, the end restraint
against rotation is zero as the single fitting
bolt has an axis parallel to the x-x axis and
thus c the fiXity coefficient is 1. For
failure by bending about the y-y axis we have
end restraint which will depend on the rigidity
of the bolt and the adjacent fitting and
structure. For this example problem, this
restraint will be such as to make the end
fixity coefficient c = 1.5.

For failure about x-x axis,


L' = L/ve= 30/VT= 30, L'/px = 30/.83

= 36
For failure about y-y axis,


L' = 30/~= 24.6, L'/P 24.6/.60
y =

= 41


Therefore failure is critical for bending
about y-y axis, with L' /p = 41.


Case 1. The material is 7079-T6 Alum. Alloy
hand forging. Fig. 20 gives the failing
stress Fc for this material plotted against
the L'/p ratio. Thus using L'/p = 41 and the
room temperature curve, we read Fc = 50500 psi.
Thus the failing load if P = FcA = 50500 x
4.375 = 220,000 Ibs.


Case 2. Using the 3000F curve in Fig. 20
for the same L'/p value, we read Fc = 40,400,
and thus P = 40,400 x 4.375 = 177,000.


Case 3. Using the 600 [0] F curve, Fc reads 6100
and thus P = 6100 x 4.375 = 26700 Ibs. Thus
subjecting this member to a temperature of
600 [0] F for 1/2 hour reduces its strength from
220,000 to 26,700 Ibs., which means that
Alum. Alloy is a poor material for carrying
loads under such temperatures since the
reduction in strength is qUite large.


Case 4. Material 17-4 PH stainless steel
forging. Fig. 19 gives the column curves
for this material. For L' /p = 41 and using
the room temperature curve we read Fc =
135,200 and thus P = 135,200 x 4.375 =
591,000 Ibs.


AIB.27 Comprehensive Treatment of Column Strength.


Columns with stable cross-sections fail as
described in Art. A18.22. However, compression
members having open sections such as angle,
channel and zee shapes, often fail by twisting
or by local buckling or crippling of one or
more of the elements that make up the shape of
the cross-section. Furthermore, the end fiXity
condition influences the column strength and



AIB.29


these end conditions depend on the type of end
fitting or connection to the adjacent structure.
Furthermore, to save weight columns are often
tapered in cross-section, that is, a variable
moment of inertia along the column length,
these equations (1) and (2) which assure constant moment of inertia do not apply. Since
elevated temperature conditions effect the
strength of a material, the column strength of
a structural member is likewise influenced.
(See Fig&. 26, 27, 28).


Since this Volume 1 is concerned primarily
with stress and strain analysis of structure,
the subject of column strength is only slightly
considered or presented. However, Volume 2,
which deals primarily with materials and
strength analys i sand d es ign of structure,
presents a very complete and broad coverage of
column design, involving over 180 pages of
theory, design charts and many sample design
problems.


AIB.2B Some Mechanical and Physical Properties of a
Few Typical Aircraft Materials.


In order to determine the true deflections
or distortions df structures under a given load
system, the values of the stiffness properties
of the material used in the structure must be
known. Chapters A7 and A8 involve the deflections of structures, thus the value of (E),
modulus of elasticity and (G), modulus of rigidity must be known if true deflections are
to be wanted. Table A18.2 gives these stiffness values for a few common aircraft structural materials and also several other strength
properties.


When a material is SUbjected to elevated
temperatures for various periods of time, the
strength and ~tiffness properties are considerably influenced as illustrated in Figs.
26 to 28, which have been taken from Volume 2.


For a comprehensive treatment of the behavior of aircraft materials and their mechanical and physical properties, the reader is referred to Chapter Bl and B2 of Volume 2, where
over 50 pages are devoted to this important
subject.

**CHAPTER A19**

**INTRODUCTION TO** **WING** **STRESS** **ANALYSIS**



**A19.1** **Typical** **Wing** **Structural** **Arrangement**


For aerodynamic reasons, the wing crosssection must have a streamlined shape commonly
referred to as an airfoil section. The aerodynamic forces in flight change in magnitude,
direction and location. Likewise in the various
landing operations the loads change in magnitUde, direction and location, thus the required
structure must be one that can efficiently
resist loads causing combined tension, compression, bending and torsion. To provide
torsional resistance, a portion of the airfoil
surface can be covered with a metal skin and
then adding one or more internal metal webs to
produce a single closed cell or a multiple cell
wing cross-section. The external skin surface
which is relatively thin for subsonic aircraft
is efficient for resisting torsional shear
stresses and tension, but qUite inefficient in
resisting compressive stresses due to bending
of wing. To provide strength efficiency, spanwise stiffening units commonly referred to as
flange stringers are attached to the inside of
the surface skin. To hold the skin surface to
airfoil shape and to provide a medium for
transferring surface air pressures to the
cellular beam structure, chordwise formers and
ribs are added. To transfer large concentrated
loads into the cellular beam structure, heavy
ribs, commonly referred to as bulkheads, are
used.


Figs. A19.1 and A18.2 illustrate typical
structural arrangements of wing cross-sections
for subsonic aircraft. The surface skin is



relatively thin. In general the wing structural
flange arrangement can be classified into two
types; (1) the concentrated flange type where
flange material is connected directly to internal webs and (2) the distributed flange type
where stringers are attached to skin between
internal webs.


Fig. **A9.3** shows several structural arran(~e­
ments for wing cross-sections for supersonic
aircraft. Supersonic airfoil shapes are
relatively thin compared to subsonic aircraft.

To withstand the high surface pressures and to

12 to 18 times the flange stringer depth. Thus,
if there were no other controlling factors, one
could easily make calculations to determine
which of the above would prove lightest. In
general, if the torsional forces on the wing
are small, thus requiring only a thin covering,
the concentrated flange type of wing structure
should prove the lightest.

In general, the flange material should be
placed to give the largest moment of inertia in
the Z direction, which means in general that the
flange material should be placed between the 15
and 50 per cent of wing chord from the leading
edge.



**Fig.A19.3** Wing Sections  - Supersonic Aircraft


In a cantilever wing, the wing bending
moments decrease rapidly spanwise from the
maximum values at the fusela~e support points.
Thus thick skin construction must be rapidly
tapered to thin skin for weight efficiency, but
thinner skin decreases allowable compressive
stresses. To promote better efficiency sandwich construction can be used in outer portion
of wing (Fig. 1). A light weight sandwich core
is glued to thin skin and thus the thin skin is
capable of resisting hi~h compressive stresses
since the core prevents sheet from buckling.


**A19.2** **Some** **Factors** **Which Influence Wing Structural**
**Arrangements**


**(1) Light Weight:**


The structural designer always strives for
the minimum weight which is practical from.a
production and cost standpoint. The hi~her the
ultimate allowable stresses, the lighter the
structures. The concentrated flange type of
wing structures as illustrated Fig. (a, b and c)
of Fig. A19.1 permits high allowable compressive
flange stresses since the flange members are
stabilized by both web and covering sheet, thus
eliminating column action, which permits design
stresses approaching the crippling stress of the
flange members. Since the flange members are
few in number, the size or thickness required is
relatively large, thus giving a high crippling
stress. On the other hand, this type of design
does not develop the effectiveness of the metal
covering on the compressive side, which must be
balanced against the saving in the weight of the
flange members.


In the distributed type of flange arrange


The secondary or distributing structure aft
of the structural box beam should be made as
light as possible and thus in general the farther
forward the rear closing web of the box beam, the
lighter the wing structure as a whole.


In the layout of the main spanwise flange
members bends or changes in direction should be
avoided as added weight is required in splicing
or in transverse stiffeners which are necessary
to change the direction of the load in the flange
members. If flange members must be spliced, care
should be taken not to splice them in the region
of a maximum cross-section. Furthermore, in
general, the smaller the number of fittings, the
lighter the structure.


**(2)** **Wing-Fuselage** **Attachment:**


If the airplane is of the low wing or the
high wing type, the entire wing structure can
continue in the way of the airplane body. However, in the mid-wing type or semi-low wing
type, limitations may prevent extending the
entire wing through the fuselage, and some of
the shear webs as well as the wing covering
must be terminated at the side of the fuselage.
If a distributed flange type of cell structure
were used, the axial load in the flange stringers would have to be transferred to the members
extending through the fuselage. To provide for
this transfer of large loads requires structural
weight and thus a concentrated flange type of
box structure might prove the best type of
structure.


**(3) Cut-outs in Wing Surface:**

The ideal arrangement where continuity of
structure is maintained over the entire surface


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-409-full.png)

of the structural box is seldom obtained in actual airplane design due to cut-outs in the
wing surface for such items as retractable
landing gears, mail compartments and bomb and
gun bays. If the distributed flange type of
box be&~ is used, they are interrupted at each
cut-out, which requires that means must be
provided for drifting the flange loads around
the opening, an arrangement which adds weight
because conservative overlapping assumptions
are usually made in the stress analysis. The
additional structure and riveting to provide
for the transfer of flange load around large
openings adds considerably to the production
cost.


For landing gears as well as many other
installations, the wing cut-outs are confined to
the lower surface, thus a structural arrangement
as illustrated in Fig. A19.4 is qUite common.
The upper surface is of the distributed flange
type whereas the lower flange material is concentrated at the two lower corners of the box.
In the normal flying conditions, the lower surface is in tension and thus cell sheet covering
between the cut-outs is equally effective in
bending if shear lag influence is discounted.
For negative accelerated flying conditions, the
lower surface is in compression thus sheet covering between corner flanges would be ineffective in bending. However, since the load factors in these flight conditions are approximately one half the normal flight load factors, this
ineffectiveness of the lower sheet in bending is
usually not critical.


Cut-outs likewise destroy the continuity of
intermediate interior shear webs of such
sections as illustrated in Figs. (c and i), and
the shear load in these interrupted webs must
be transferred around the opening by special
bUlkheads on each side of the cut-out, which
means extra weight.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-409-0.png)


In many cases, cut-outs in the leading edge
are necessary due to power plant installations,
landing gear wells, etc. Furthermore, in many
airplanes, it is desirable to make the leading
edge portion removable for inspection of the
many installations which occupy this space in
the portion of the wing near the fuselage. If
such is the case, then an interior web should
be located near the front of the wing section.


Inspection doors for the central portion of
the box beam structure are usually loce.tee-I on



**A19.3**


the lower side of the wing. They are usually
fastened to two spanwise stringers with screws
and the removable panels are effective in resisting bending and shear load. (See Fig.A19.5)


Removable panel for
Fig. **A19. 5** assembly and inspection
purposes.


Cutouts in the wing structural box destroys
the continuity of the torsional resistance of
the cell and thus special consideration must be
given to carrying torsional forces around the
cut-out. This special problem is discussed
later.


(4) Folding-Wings:


For certain airplanes, particularly Carrier
based Naval airplanes, it is necessary that provision be made to fold the outer wing panels upward. This dictates definite hinge points between the outer and center wing panels. If a
distributed flange type of structure is used,
the flange forces must be gathered and transferred to the fitting points, thus a compromise
solution consisting of a small number of spanwise members is common practice.


(5) Wing Flutter Prevention:


With the high speeds now obtained by modern
airplanes, careful attention to wing flutter
prevention must be given in the structural layout and design of the wing. In general, the
critical flutter speed depends to a great extent on the torsional rigidity of the wing.
When the mass center of gravity moves aft of the
25 per cent of chord point, the critical flutter
speed decreases, thus it is important to keep
weight of the wing forward. At high speeds
where "compressibility" effects become important,
the torsional forces on the wing are increased,
which necessitates extra skin thickness or a
larger cell. Designing for flutter prevention
is a highly specialized problem.


(6) Ease and Cost of Production:


The airplane industry is a mass production
industry and therefore the structural layout of
the wing must take into account production
methods. The general tendency at this time is
to design the wing and body structure, so that
sub-assemblies of the various parts can be made,
which are finally brought together to form the
final assembly of the wing panel. To make this
process efficient requires careful consideration
in the details and layout of the wing structure.

break-down of the structural parts of an airplane of a leading airplane company. Fabrication and assembly of these units permits the
installation of much equipment before assembly
of the units to the final assembly.


A19.3 Wing Strength Requirements


Two major strength requirements must be
satisfied in the structural design of a wing.
They are: - (1) Under the applied or limit
loads, no part of the structure must ~
stressed beyond the yield stress of the material. In general, the yield stress is that
stress which causes a permanent strain of
0.002 inches per inch. The terms applied or
limit refer to the same loads, which are the
maximum loads that the airplane should encounter during its lifetime of operations.
(2) The structure shall also carry Design Loads
without rupture or collapse or in other words
failure. The magnitude of the Design Loads
equals the Applied Loads times a factor of
safety (F.S.). In general, the factor of
safety for aircraft is 1.5, thus the structure
must withstand 1.5 times the applied loads
without failure. In missiles, since no human
passengers are involved, the factor of safety
is less and appears at this time to range
between 1.15 to 1.25.


Aircraft factors of safety are rather low
compared to other fields of structural design,
chiefly because weight saving is so important
in obtaining a useful transportation vehicle
relative to useful load and performance.
Since safety is the paramount design requirement, the correctness of the theoretical design
must be checked by extensive static and dynamic
tests to verify whether the structure will
carry the design loads without failure.


A19.4 Wing Stress Analysis Methods


In many of the previous chapters of this
book, internal forces were calculated for both
statically determinate and statically indeterminate structures. The internal loads in a
statically determinate structure can be found
by the use of the static equilibrium equations
alone. The over-all structural arrangement of
members is necessary, but the size or shape of
no individual member is required. In other
words, design consists of finding internal
loads and then supplying a member to carry this
load safely and efficiently. In a statically
indeterminate structure, additional equations
beyond the static equilibrium equations are
necessary to find all the internal stresses.
The additional equations are supplied from a
consideration of structural distortions, which
means that the size and shape and kind of
material for members of the structure must be
known before internal stresses can be determined. This fact means a trial and error method



A19.5


is necessary. Another important distinction is
that a statically determinate wing structure
has just enough members to produce stability
and if one member is removed or fails, the
entire structure will usually fail, whereas a
statically indeterminate structure has one or
more additional members than are necessary for
static stability and thus some members could
fail without causing the entire structure to
collapse. In other words, the structure has
a fail safe characteristic in that a redistribution of internal stress can take place if
some members are over loaded. In general,
statically indeterminate structures can be
designed lighter and with smaller overall deflections.


METHODS OF STRESS ANALYSIS FOR STATICALLY
INDETERMINATE WING STRUCTURES


Two general methods are commonly used,
namely,


(1) Flexural beam theory with simplifying
assumptions.


(2) Solving for redundant forces and stresses
by applying the principles of the elastic
theory by various methods such as virtual
work, strain energy, etc.


The second method is no doubt more accurate since less assumptions are necessary. A
wing structure composed of several cells and
many spanwise stringers is a many degree redundant structure. Before the development of
high speed computing machinery, so-called
rigorous methods were not usable because the
computing requirements were impossible or
entirely impractical. However, present day
computer facilities have changed the situation
and rigorous methods are now being more and
more used in aircraft structural analysis. Art.
A7.9 and A8.10 in Chapters A7 and A8 present
matrix methods for finding deflections and
stresses to be used with computer facilities.


A19.5 Example Problem 1. 3-Flange ~ Single Cell
Wing.


Fig. A19.7 shows a portion of a cantilever
wing. To provide torsional strength a single
closed cell (1) is formed by the interior web
AB and the metal skin cover forward of this
web. Thin sheet is relatively weak in resisting compressive stresses thus 3 flange stringers
A, Band C are added to develop efficient bending resistance. The structure to the rear of
spar AB is referred to as secondary structure
and consists of thin metal or fabric covering
attached to chordwise wing ribs. The air load
In this portion is therefore carried forward
by the ribs to the single cell beam.


A wing is subjected to many flight condi

A19.6 ANALYSIS OF WING STR UCT ORES



tions. The engineers who calculate the applied
loads on the wing usually refer the resulting
shears and moments to a set of convenient x, y
and z axes. Fig. A19.7 shows the location of
these reference axes. The job of the stress
engineer is to provide structure to resist
these loads safely and efficiently. The general
procedure is to find the stresses or loads in
all parts of the cell cross-section at several
stations along the spanwise direction and from
these loads or stresses proportion the required
areas, thicknesses and shapes.


In this example, the internal loads will
be calculated for only one section, namely,
that at Station 240. It will be assumed that
the design critical loads from the critical
flight condition are as follows.


tlx = 1,100,000 in. lb. V z = 11,500 lb.


tlz = 80,000 in.lb. V x = 700 lb.


tly = 460,500 in. lb.


Fig. A19.8 shows these shears and moments
referred to the reference axes with origin at
point (0). tloments are represented by vectors
with double arrow head. The sense of the
moment follows the right hand rule.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-412-0.png)

ASSUMPTIONS:   - It will be assumed that the
3 flange stringers A, Band C develop the entire
resistance to the bending moments about the Z
and X axes. For skin under compression this
assumption is nearly correct since the skin will
buckle under relatively low stress. Since sheet
can take tensile stresses, this assumption is
conservative. However, since the thin sheet
cover must resist the shear stresses we will
make this conservative assumption. The main
advantage of this approximate assumption is
that it makes the structure statically determinate.


Fig. A19.8 shows the wing cut at Station
240. The unknown forces are the three axial
loads in the stringers A, Band C and the three
shear flows Qab' Qac and qbc on the three sheet
panels, making a total of 6 unknowns and since
there are 6 static equilibrium equations available for a space structure, the structure is
statically determinate.


Since the size and shape of flange members
A, Band C are unknown, we guess their centroid
locations as indicated by the dots in Fig.A19.8.
The axial load in each of the 3 stringers has
been replaced by its x, y and z components as
shown on the figure. The external applied loads
are given at the reference origin (0) as shown
in Fig.A19.8. Y axis is normal to cross section.


We now apply the equations of equilibrium
to find the 6 unknowns •


To find C y take moments about Z axis through
points A and B. C y is normal to cross section.


ZMz(ab) =- 22 Cy + 80000 = 0, whence
Cy = 3636 lb.


The result comes out with a plus sign thus
indicating that the assumed sense of tension
was correct.


To find By take moments about an X axis
thru (A). By is normal to section.

To find Ay take ZF y = 0


ZF y =- 100,043 - 3636 + Ay = 0,

whence, Ay = 103679 lb. and compression as assumed.


Since the direction of the 3 stringers is
known, we can find the X and Z components of
the stringer loads by simple geometry.


The y, x, and z length components of the
three stringers from the dimensions given in

|Member|y|x|z|
|---|---|---|---|
|A|240|6.2|3|
|B|240|6.2|3|

The force components are therefore:   

Az = 103679 x 3/240 = 1296 lb.


Ax = [103679 x] [ 6.2/240] = [2679] [ lb.]


Bz = 100043 x 3/240 = 1250 lb.


Bx = 100043 x 6.2/240 = 2584 lb.

Cz = 3636 x 3/240 = 45 lb.

Cx = 3636 x 20.93/240 = 316 lb.

whence Qac = 35.45 Ib./in. with sense as
assumed.


To find Qab take ZF z = 0


~Fz =- 1296 - 1250 + 45 + 35.45 x 0.5   11.5 x 13.66 + 11500 - 11 Qab = 0


whence, Qab = 805 lb. /in.


The loads on the stringers and sheet panels
have now been determined. The axial load in the
stringers is practically equal to their y component since axial load equals their y force
component divided by the cosine of a small
angle. The stress engineer would find similar
stresses at a number of stations along the span
These 6 stresses are generally referred to as
primary stresses. Usually in most structures
there are secondary stress effects which must
be considered before final member sizes can be
determined. For example, internal webs of a
box type beam are designed usually as semitension field beams. Tension field beam theory
shows that the flange members are SUbjected to
additional stresses besides the primary stresses
as found above. The SUbject of secondary
stresses and the strength design of members
and their connections to carry given stress
loads is taken up in detail in later chapters.


A19.6 Example Problem 2. Metal Covered Wing With Single
External Brace Strut.


In Chapter A2, the stress analysis of an
externally braced fabric covered monoplane wing
was considered. To provide sufficient torsional strength and rigidity, two external brace
struts were necessary. However, if a wing is
metal covered, a single external brace strut
can be used, since the closed cell or cells
formed by the metal sheet covering and the internal webs prOVide the torsional resistance
and the wing can be designed as a s imply supported beam with cantilever overhang. An
excellent example of this type of wing structure is the Cessna aircraft Model 180 as shown
in the photograph. An excellent airplane
relative to performance, ease of manufacture
and maintenance.

monoplane wing with one external brace strut.
The wing panel is attached to fuselage by
single pin fittings at points A and B with pin
axes parallel to x axis. The mating lugs of
the fittings at point A are made snug fit but
those at B with some gap, thus drag reaction
of wing loads on fuselage is resisted entirely
at fitting A. Since the fittings at A and B
cannot resist moments about x axis, it is
necessary to add an external brace strut DC to
make structure stable. The panel structure
consists of a main spar ACE and a rear spar BF.
The entire panel is covered with metal skin
forward of the rear spar.

A simplified air load has been assumed as
shown in Fig. A19.12, namely, a lmiform load
w = 30.27 lb./in. of span acting at the 30 per
cent of chord point. When this resultant load
is resolved into z and x components the results
are Wz = 30 lb./in. and Wx = 4 lb./in. as shown
in Fig. A19.12.


The general physical action of the wing
structure in carrying these air loads can be
considered as 3 rather distinct actions,
namely, (1) The front spar ACE resists the
bending moments and shears due to load wz .,
(2) The skin and webs of the two-cell tube
resists all moments about y axis or broadly
speaking torsional moments, (3) the entire panel
cross-section resists the bending moment and
flexural shear due to drag load wx, with the
top and bottom skin acting as webs and the two
spars as the flanges of this box beam.


General Calculations: 

The unknown external reactions (see Fig.
A19.11) are Ay, Az, Ax, By, Bz and DC., or a
total of 6. Since 6 static equations of
equilibrium are available, the reactions are
statically determinate. Reaction DC is also
the load in brace strut DC.


To find reaction DC take moments about x
axis through points A, B


ZMx(AB) = (- 170 x 30 x 170/2) + DC(80/99.4)60
= 0


whence, DC = 8979 lb. (The sign comes out
plus so the sense assumed in Fig. A19.11 was
correct.) The load in the strut is therefore
8979 lb. tension.


To find B, take moments about a z axis
through point 1A).


ZMZ(A) =- (4 x 170 x 170/2) + 27 By = 0


whence, By = 2141 lb. acting with sense
assumed.


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-415-full.png)

To find Ay take ZF y = 0


ZFy = 2141 - 8979 (80/99.4) + Ay = 0


whence Ay = 5085 lb.


To find Bz take moments about y axis
through (A).


ZMy(A) = + (30 x 170 x 3) - 27 Bz = 0


whence Bz = 567 lb. acting as assumed.


To find Az take ZF z = 0


ZFz = 170 x 30 - 567 - (8979 x 59/99.4)
+ A z = 0


whence Az = 796 lb. acting as assumed.


The fittings at A and B should be designed
to take the reactions at these points as found
above. The external strut DC and its end
fittings must carry the tension load of 8979 lb.

The torsional moment of 90 in. lb. per
inch of span is resisted by the cellular tube
made up of two cells (1) and (2). In many
designs the leading edge cell is neglected in
resisting the torsional moments due to many
cutouts, etc., thus cell one could be assumed
to provide the entire torsional shear resistance and the shear flow for this case would be
q = Mv/2A Where My equals the torsional moment
at a given panel section and A the enclosed
area of cell (1). If both cells were considered effective then the sheet thickness is
necessary before solution for shear flow can
be computed. Refer to Chapter A6 for computing
torsional shear flow in mUltiple cell tubes.


The maximum torsional moment would be at
the fuselage end of the wing panel and its
magnitude would be 170 x 90 = 15300 in. lb.
Since the top and bottom skin is not attached
to fuselage, this torsional moment myst be
thrown off on a rib at the end of the panel
and this rib in turn transfers this moment in
terms of a couple reaction on the spars at



The y and z components of the strut reaction at C will then be,


Cy = 8979 (80/99.4) = 7226 lb.


Cz = 8979 (59/99.4) = 5329 lb.


These values are indicated on Fig. A19.14.


To find Ay take ZF y = 0


ZF y =- 7226 + Ay = 0, hence Ay = 7226 lb.


In finding the reaction Ay previously, the value
was 5085 lb. The difference is due to the drag
bending moment Which tends to put a tension load
on front spar and compression on the rear spar.

increasing from zero at tip to 2141 lb. at
fuselage attachment points and varying as y2.
At point C on from spar the axial tension load
would be .074 (90 [2] ) = 600 lb.


The design of the front spar between
points C and E would be nothing more than a
cantilever beam subjected to a bending forces
plus an axial tensile load plus a torsional
shear flow. The design of the spar between
points C and A is far more complicated since
we have appreciable secondary bending moments
to determine, which must be added to the primary bending moments. Fig. A19.15a shows a
free body of spar portion AC.

The lateral load of 30 Ib./in. bends the
beam upward, thus the axial loads at A and C
will have a moment arm due to beam deflection
Which moments are referred to as secondary
moments. To find deflections the beam moment
of inertia must be known, thus the design of
this beam portion would fall in the trial and
error procedure. Articles A5.23 to 28 of
Chapter A5 explain and illustrate solution of
problems involving beam-column action and such
a procedure would have to be used in actually
designing this b6am portion.


The rear spar BF receives two load systems,
namely a varying axial load of zero at F to 2141
lb. at B and the web of this spar receives a
shear load from the torsional moment. The
rear spar is not subjected to bending moments.


In Fig. A9.10 the secondary structure
consisting of chordwise ribs and spanwise light
stringers riveted to skin are not shown. This
secondary structure is neceosary to hold wing
contour shape and transfer air pressures to
the box structure. This secondary structure
is discussed in Chapter A21. The broad subject
of designing a member or structure to Withstand
stresses safely and efficiently is considered
in detail in later chapters.


A19.7 Single Spar - Cantilever Wing Metal Covered


A single spar cantilever wing with metal
covering is often used particularly in light
commercial or private pilot aircraft.


Suppose in the single spar externally
braced wing of Fig. A19.11, that the external
brace strut DC was removed. Obviously the wing
would be unstable as it would rotate about hinge
fittings at points A and B. To make the
structure stable the single pin fitting at _(A)_



would have to be replaced by two fittings, one
on the upper flange and the other on the lower
flange in order to be able to resist a Mx
moment. Fig. A19.16 shows this modification.
The fitting at B could remain as before, a single
pin fitting.


Fig. A19.16

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-416-0.png)


The stress analysis of this wing would consist
of the spar AE resisting all the Mx moments and
the Vz shears and acting as a cantilever beam.
The torsional moment about a y axis coinciding
with spar AE would be resisted by shear stresses
in the cellular tubes formed by the skin and the
spar webs. The drag bending and shear forces
would be resisted by the beam whose flanges are
the front and rear spars and the web being the
top and bottom skin.


A19.8 Stress Analysis of Thin Skin - Multiple Stringer
Cantilever Wing. Introduction and Assumptions.


The most common type of wing construction
is the multiple stringer type as illustrated by
the six illustrative cross-sections in Fig.
A19.2. A structure with many stringers and
sheet panels is statically indeterminate to
many degrees With respect to internal stresses.
Fortunately, structural tests of complete wing
structures show that the simple beam theory
gives stresses which check fairly well with
measured stresses if the wing span is several
times the wing chord, that sweep back is minor
and wing is free of major cutouts and discontinuities. Thus it is common procedure to
analyze and design a wing overall by the beam
theory and then investigate those portions of
the wing where the beam theory may be in error
by using more rigorous analysis methods such as
those explained and illustrated in Art. A8.10
of Chapter _A8._


ASSUT1PTIONS - BEAM THEORY


In this chapter the wing bending and shear
stresses will be calculated using the unsymmetrical beam theory. The two main assumptions in this theory are: 

(1) Transverse sections of the beam originally
plane before bending remain plane after bending
of beam. This assumption means that longitudinal strain varies directly as the distance from


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-417-full.png)

the neutral axis or strain variation is linear.


(2) The longitudinal stress distribution is
directly proportional to strain and therefore
from assumption (1) is also linear. This
assumption actually means that each longitudinal
element acts as if it were separate from every
other element and that Hook's law holds,
namely, that the stress-strain curve is linear.


Assumption (1) neglects strain due to shear
stresses in skin, which influence is commonly
referred to as shear lag effect. Shear lag
effects are usually not important except near
major cut-outs or other major discontinuities
and also locations where large concentrated
external forces are applied.


Assumption (2) is usually not correct if
elastic and inelastic buckling of skin and
stringers occur before failure of wing. In
applying the beam theory to practical wings,
the error of this assumption is corrected by
use of a so-called effective section which is
discussed later.


A19.9 Physical Action of Wing Section in Resisting External
Bending Forces from Zero to Failing Load.


Fig. A19.17 shows a common type of wing
cross-section structural arrangement generally
referred to as the distributed flange type.

Fig. A19.17
The corner members (a) and (b) are considerably
larger in area than the stringers (c). The
skin is relatively thin. Now assume the wing
is subjected to gradually increasing bending
forces which place the upper portion of this
wing section in compression and the bottom
portion in tension. Under small loading the
compressive stresses in the top surface will
be small and the stress will be directly proportional to strain and the beam formula
0c = MxZ/Ix will apply and the moment of
inertia Ix will include all of the crosssection material. As the external load is increased the compressive stresses on the thin
sheets starts to buckle the sheet panels and
further resistance decreases rapidly as further
strain continues, or in other words, stress is
not directly proportional to strain when sheet
buckles. Buckling of the skin panels however
does not cause the beam to fail as the stringers
and corner members are lowly stressed compared
to their failing stress. The stringers (c)
are only supported transversely at wing rib
points and thus the stringers act as columus and
fail by elastic or inelastic bending. The



AI9.11


corner flange members (a) and (b) are stabilized
in two directions by the skin and webs and
usually fail by local crippling.


Now continuing the loading of the wing
after the skin has buckled, the stringers and
corner members will continue to take additional
compressive stress. Since the ultimate strength
of the stringers is less than that of the corner members, the stringers (c) will start to
bend elastically or inelastically and will take
practically no further stress as additional
strain takes place. The corner members still
have considerable additional strength and thus
additional external loading can be applied until
finally the ultimate strength of the corner
members is reached and then complete failure of
the top portion of the beam section takes place.
Therefore, the true stress - strain relationship
does not follow Hook's Law when such a structure
is loaded to failure.


In the above discussion the stringers (c)
were considered to hold their ultimate buckling
load during considerable additional axial
strain. This can be verified experimentally
by testing practical columns.. Practical columns are not perfect relative to straightness,
uniformity of material, etc. Fig. A19.18
shows the load versus lateral deflection of
column midpoint as a column is loaded to failure
and fails by elastic bending. Fig. A19.19 shows
similar results when the failure is inelastic
bending.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-417-0.png)


{j = Central Deflection {j = Central Deflection


The test results show that a compression
member which fails in bending, normally continues to carry approximately the maximum load
under considerable additional axial deformation.
Thus in the beam section of Fig. A19.17 when
the stringers (c) reach their ultimate load,
failure of the beam does not follow since corner members (a) and (b) still have remaining
strength.


A19.10 Ultimate Strength Design Requirement


The strength design requirements are:   

(1) Under the applied or limit loads, no
structural member shall be stressed above
the material yield point, or in other
words, there must be no permanent deformation or deflection of any part of the
structure.


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-418-full.png)

A19.12 ANALYSIS OF WING STRUCTURES



(2) Under the design loads which equal the
applied loads times a factor of safety,
no failure of the structure shall occur.
The usual factor of safety for conventional
aircraft is 1.5, or the structure must
carry loads 50 percent greater than the
applied loads without failure. The higher
the stress at failure of a member the less
material required and therefore the less
structural weight. The stress engineer
thus tries to design members which fail in
the inelastic zone.


The bending stress beam formula 0 C = Mc/I
does not take care of this non-linear stressstrain action and thus some modification of the
moment of inertia of the beam cross-section is
necessary if the ultimate strength of a wing
section is to be computed fairly accurately.
The stress engineer usually solves this problem
by using a modified cross-section, usually
referred to as the effective cross-section.


AI9.11 Effective Section at Failing Load.


In order to use the beam formula which
assumes linear stress-strain relation,
corrections to take care of skin buckling and
stringer buckling must be formulated. The
effectiveness of the skin panels will be considered first.



![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-418-0.png)

Fig. A19.21

stress equal to the stringer stress. In Fig.
A19.21 2w is the effective sheet width to go
with each stringer. The total stress on the
effective widths carrying a uniform stress equal
to the stringer stress equals the total load on
the sheet panels carrying the actual varying
stress distribution. The equation for effective
width is usually written in the form,


    - 2w = kt (E/ast)2" ~


a widely used value for K = 1.9, whence


2w = 1.90 t (E/0st)~   - - - - - - - - - (1)


0st = stress in stringer


Therefore if we know the stress in the
stringer we can find the width of sheet to use
with the stringer to obtain an effective section
to take care of the sheet buckling influence.


Effective Factor for Buckled Stringers.


Consider the beam section in Fig. A19.1?
If we take a stringer (c) and attach a piece of
sheet to it equal to 2w, the effective width
and test it in compression and brace it in a
plane parallel to the sheet, the resulting test
stress versus strain shortening curve (c) of
Fig. A19.22 will result. The length of the test
specimen would equal the rib spacing in the
wing. The corner members (a) or (b) in Fig.
A19.1? being stabilized in two directions will
fail by local crippling, thus if a short piece
of this member is tested to failure in compression the test curve _(A)_ in Fig. A19.22 is
obtained. Curve (C) shows that the stringer
holds approximately its maximum load for a
considerable strain period. Curve (A) shows
that for the same unit strain member (a) can
take considerable higher stress. If we take
a unit strain of .006, the point at which the
maximum stress of 47000 is obtained in member
(a) (see point (3) on Curve A) then the stress
at the same strain for member (C) will be 38000
(see point (2) on Curve C).


 - The buckling of sheets is taken up in detail in
Chapter _C5._



When a compressive load is applied to a
sheet stringer combination, the thin sheet
buckles at rather low stress. For further
loading the compressive stress various over
the panel width as illustrated in Fig. A19.20.
The stress in the sheet at the stringer attachment line is the same as in the stringer since
it cannot buckle and therefore suffers the same
strain as the stringer. Between the stringers
the sheet stress decreases as shown by the
dashed line in Fig. A19.20. This variable
stress condition is difficult to handle so the
stress engineer makes a convenient substitution
by replacing the actual sheet with its variable
stress by a width of sheet carrying a uniform

For stress analysis procedure using the
beam formula, we assume a linear stress variation from zero to 47000 psi. Since stringers
(c) can only take 38000 psi at the same strain,
or in other words, stringer (c) is less effective than members (a) and (b). The effectiveness factor for stringer (c) equals its ultimate strength divided by the ultimate strength
of member (a) or 38000/47000 = .808.


A19.12 Example Problem


The wing section in Fig. A19.23 is subjected to a design bending moment about the x
axis of 500,000 in.lb., acting in a direction
to put the upper portion in compression. The
problem is to determine the margin of safety
for this design bending moment. The material
is 2024 aluminum alloy.

SOLUTION



.04



Fig. A19.23



Tne beam formula for bending stress at any
point is crb = MxZ/Ix • To solve this equation
we must have the effective moment of inertia
of the beam cross-section. The bottom surface
being in tension under the given design bending
moment is entirely effective, however the top
surface has a variable effectiveness since the
skin, stringers and corner flange members have
different ultimate failing stresses.


From equation (1) the effective width of



A19.13


sheet to use with each rivet line depends on
the stress in the stringer to which it is
attached. The failing stress for the stringer
will be used, which means that the failing
stress of the stringers and corner flanges must
be known before the effective width can be
found. For this example the zee stringers have
been selected of such a size as to give an
ultimate column failing stress of 38000 psi,
and the corner flange members have been made of
such size and shape as to give a failing stress
of 47000 psi. These failing stresses can be
computed by theory and methods as given in
Chapter C7. The sizes have purposely been
selected to given strengths represented by the
test curves of Fig. A19.22.


The effective width with each rivet line
from equation (1) would be,


For zee stringer 2W = 1.90 x .04 (10.5 x


J.
10 [8] /38000)2 = 1.25 inches


Thus the area of effective skin = 1.25 x
.04 = .05 in. [2] - The area of the zee stringer
is 0.135 sq. in. which added to the effective
skin area gives 0.185 sq. in. which value is
entered in Column (2) of Table I opposite zee
stringers numbered 2, 3 and 4 in Fig. A19.23.
The same procedure is done for the corner members 1 and 5 with the resulting effective areas
as given in Table I. On the bottom side which
is in tension all material is effective. The
skin width equal to one-half the distance to
adjacent stringers is assumed to act with each
stringer. Taking the area of the angle section
as 0.11 and adding skin area equal to 6 x .035
= .21 or a total of 0.32 sq. in. which value is
shown in Column 2 of Table I opposite stringers
7, 8 and 9. The areas of the lower corner
members plus bottom skin and web skin would
come out as recorded in the Table.


The next step is to correct for stringer
effectiveness in compression. The failing
stress for the zee stringer was given as 38000
and for the corner members 47000 psi. The
effectiveness factor for the zee stringer thus
equals 38000/47000 = .808. This factor is recorded in Column 3 of Table I. For the corner
members 1 and 5 and all the tension members the
factor is of course unity. The balance of
Table I gives the calculation of the effective
moment of inertia ~AZ2 about the x neutral axis.


The compressive stress intensity at the
centroid of the zee stringers thus equals,


crb ~ MxZ/Ix = 500,000 x 5.57/59.80 = 46600 psi.


The true stress equals the effectiveness
factor times this stress = .808 x 46600 =
37400 psi. The failing stress equals 38000
hence margin of safety = (38000/37400) - 1 =
.01 or one percent.

On corner members (1) and (5) the compressive stress = 500,000 x 5.47/59.80 =
45000 psi. With the failing stress being
47000 the margin of safety is 2 percent.


Now suppose we would have omitted consideration of the stringer effectiveness factor
and omitted column (3) of Table I. Carrying
through the calculations of Table I, the value
of Z would be -0.76" and Ix would be 63.08.
The stress intensity on the zee stringers
would then be 500000 x 5.36/63.08 = 42500 psi.
Since the failing stress for stringer is 38000
the margin of safety would be (38000/42500) - 1
= a negative 10.5 percent. The previous result
was a plUS 1 percent, thus a difference of 11.5
percent in the results.


The purpose of this simple example problem
was to emphasize to the stUdent that failure of
real aircraft stiffened skin structures occurs
under non-linear stress-strain conditions and
the elastic theory must be modified if fairly
accurate estimates of the failing strength of
a composite structure is to be obtained.


A19.13 Bending and Shear stress Analysis of Tapered Multiple stringer Cantilever Wing. Unsymmetrical
Beam Method.

In general cantilever wings are tapered in
both depth and planform. Fig. A19.24 illustrates a typical structural layout of the outer
wing panel for a small airplane. The structure
consists of a front and rear beam (spar) with
spanwise stringers between the two beams.
Tapering in cross-sectional material is obtained
by decreasing size of members by cutting off
portions of the spanwise stringers and corner
flanges and decreasing the skin and web thick
ness.



The stress analysis of this wing would
show the resulting bending and shear stresses
for a number of spanwise stations for the critical design load conditions. In this example
solution the bending longitudinal stresses will
be determined on cross-sections at two stations,
namely, stations 20 and 47.5, and the shear
stresses will be determined for station 20. In
this example problem, the leading edge cell will
be considered ineffective as well as any structure to rear of rear beam, hence structure is a
one cell beam with multiple stringers. A second
solution including the leading edge cell to form
a two cell beam will also be presented.


ANALYSIS FOR BENDING LONGITUDINAL STRESSES


Longitudinal stresses (tension or compression) are produced by external forces normal
to the cross-section and by bending moments
about x and z axes. The stress equations are:



On = PIA


where on = longitudinal stress



(2)



P = external load acting through centroid of effective wing cross-section


A = effective area of cross-section.


For any given flange member With area (a)
the load Pn on the member would be,



Pn = ona - 


- - - (3)



The stresses due to bending moments are
from Chapter A13, Art. A13.5: 

where 0b = bending stress with plus being tenSion


K 2 = Iz/(Ix Iz


K" = Ix/ (Ix Iz


The normal component of the axial load in
a flange member equals 0b a) where (a) is the
area of the flange member. Since the angle between the normal to the beam section and the
centroidal axis of a stringer is generally qUite
small, the difference between the cosine of a
small angle and unity is negligible and thus
the normal component can be considered as the
axial load in the stringer.


Before equations 2, 3 and 4 can be solved,
the effective cross-section area must be known
as well as the moments of inertia and product
of inertia about x and z centroidal axes.

Fig. A19.26 WING SECTION STATION 47.5


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-423-full.png)

Fig. A19.25 shows the cross section at
Station 20 divided into 14 longitudinal units
numbered 1 to 14. Since the external load condition to be used places the top surface in
compression, the skin will buckle and thus we
use the effective width procedure to obtain the
skin portion to act with each stringer. Fig.
A19.25 shows the effective skin which is used
with each flange member to give the total area
of numbers (1) to (7). The skin on the bottom
surface being in tension is all effective and
Fig. A19.25 shows the skin area used with each
bottom flange member.


The next factor to decide is the stringer
effectiveness as discussed and explained in the
previous example problem. For the structure of
Fig. A19.25 we will assume that the compressive
failing stress of the stringers is the same as
that for the corner members, thus we will have
no correction factor to take care of the
situation of flange members having different
Ultimate strengths.


Table A19.2, columns 1 to 11, and the
calculations below the table give the calculations for determining the section properties
at Station 20, namely A, Ix, Iz and Ixz .
Table A19.3 gives the same for wing section at
Station 47.5. The areas in column (2) are less
since sizes have changed between Stations 20
and 47.5.


Calculation of longitudinal stress due to
Mx and My bending moments: 

The design bending moments will be assumed
and are as follows: 

Station 20 Mx = 1,300,000 in. lb.

Mz =        - 285,000 in.lb.


Station 47.5 Mx = 1,000,000 in. lb.


Mz =        - 215,000 in. lb.


The moments about the y axes are not
needed in the bending stress analysis but are
needed in the shear analysis which will be made
later.


To solve equation (4) the constants K 4,
K 2 and K" must be known.


For Station 20 from Table A19.2, Ix =
230.3, Iz = 1030 and Ixz =- 50, whence 

K 4 = Ixz/O x Iz - Ixz 2 ) = -50/(230.3 x 10.30


     - 50 [2 ] ) = -50/235500 = -.0002125


K 2 = Iz/235500 = 1030/235500 = .004378


K 3 = Ix/235500 = 230.3/235500 = .00098



Column 12 of Table A19.2 gives the results
of this equation for values of x and z in
columns 10 and 11. Multiplying these bending
stresses by the stringer areas, the stringer
loads are given in column 13. The sum of the
loads in thiS column should be zero since total
tension must equal total compression on a section in bending.


Stresses at station 47.5:


Ix = 157.4, Iz = 700, Ixz = -35.4 (Table
A19.3)


K 4 = 35.4/(157.4 x 700 - 35.4 [2 ] ) =
-35.4/108950 = -.000324


K 2 = 700/108950 = .00643


K 3 = 157.4/108750 = .001447


ab =- [.001447 x -215000 - (-.000324 x

1,000,000)J x - [(.00643 x 1,000,000

(-.00324 x -215000)J z


whence


ab = -14.5 x -6360 z


Column 12 of Table A19.3 gives the results
of this equation and column 13, the total
stringer loads at station 47.5.


The stresses in column 12 of each table
would be compared to the failing stress of the
flange members to obtain the margin of safety.


ANALYSIS FOR SHEAR STRESSES IN WEBS AND SKIN


The shear flow distribution will be calculated by using the change in axial load in
the stringers between stations 20 and 47.5, a
method commonly referred to as the 6P method.
For explanation of this method, refer to Art.
A15.16 of Chapter A15.


The shear flow in the y direction at a
point n of the cell wall equals,


n 6P
= qo   - Z -   - - - - - - - - - - - (6)
o d


where qo is a known value of shear flow at some
point 0 and the second term is the change in
shear flow between points 0 and n.



**A19.17**


Substituting in equation (4)


ab =- [.00098 x - 285000 - (-.0002125 x


1300000)J x - [.004378 x 1,300,000   

(-.0002125 x - 285000)J z



whence, ab = 3.3 x - 5639 z 


- - (5)

~p equals the change in stringer axial load
over a distance d in the y direction.


Since the cell in our problem is closed the
value qo at any point is unknown. We assume it
zero on web 1-14 by imagining that the web is
cut as shown in Fig. A19.27. Equation (6) thus
reduces to,

areas are referred as m values (See Fig. A19.27).
Column 6 of Table A19.4 records these double
areas which were obtained by use of a planimeter.
Column (7) gives the moment of each shear flow
about the c.g. and the total of this column
gives the moment about the c.g. of the complete
shear flow system of Fig. A19.27 or a value of
256060 in. lb.



- - - - - - - The double areas (m) can be found approxi(7) mately as follows:



Columns 1 to 5 of Table A19.4 show the solution
of equation (7). The shear flow values of qy
in column 5 are plotted on the cell wall in
Fig. A19.27, remembering that qy = qx = qz. For
rules giving direction of qx and qz refer to
Chapter A14, Art. A14.6.

The moment of
the shear flow q on
the web (2-3) about
point 0 equals q
times twice the area
(A 1 + A 2 ). In most
cases, the area A 2
can be neglected.


By simple
geometry, the area

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-425-0.png)
A 1 = 1/2 (X 3 Z2 - X2Z 3 ). The moment of the
shear flow q on web (2-3) thus equals q (X 3 Z2

- X 2 Z3)' Since values of X and Z for all
flange points with reference to section (c.g.)
are given in the Table AI9.2, it is unnecessary
to use the planimeter except for regions of
sharp curvature.


MOMENT OF EXTERNAL LOADS
ABOUT c.g. OF STATION 20


As stated before the engineers in the
applied loads calculation group supply the shears
and moments at various spanwise stations. We
will assume that these loads are: V z = 12000
lb., V x = +·2700 lb., My =- 390,000 in.lb. The
location of the reference y axis used by the
loads group will be assumed as located at point
o in Fig. A19.28 relative to cross-section at
Station 20.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-425-2.png)


Therefore moment of external loads about
c.g. is,


Z'Mc.g. = 12000 x 33.3 - 2700 x 11.8 - 390000

= 41800 in. lb.


Moments Produced by Inclination of Flange Loads With
Beam Section.


Since the flange members in general are not
normal to the beam sections, the flange loads

lations as was used in the previous single cell
problem, the bending and shear stresses will be
determined for the same structure as in the
previous example except that the leading edge
cell is considered effective, thus making a
2-cell structure. Since there are no spanwise
stringers in the leading edge, very little skin
on the compressive side will be effective. On
the tension side, the leading edge skin would
be effective in resisting bending axial loads
and thus the moment of inertia would be slightly
different from that found in example problem 1.
Since this problem is only for the purpose of
illustrating the use of the equations, the
leading edge skin will be neglected in computing
the bending flexural stresses. With this
assumption, the bending stresses and flange
loads at stations 20 and 47.5 are the same as
for the previous problem. (See values in column
12 and 13 of Tables A19.2 and A19.3.)



A19.21


The first 7 columns of this table are the same
as in Table A19.4, since no stringers have been
added to cell (1), and the shear q is assumed
zero in cell (1).


To make the twist of each cell the same and
also to make the summation of all torsional
forces zero will require two unknown constant
shear flows, q~ in cell (1) and q2 in cell (2).
Thus two equations will be written, namely:


(8)



m c • g . = 0


The twist 9 per unit length of a cell
equals


1
9 = 2AG t;qL/t



(9)


(10)



, Shear Flow Calculations: - The modulus of rigidity G will be assumed constant and thus will be omitted.



To compute the static shear flow, each cell
is assumed cut at one point as shown in Fig.
A19.31, and thus the shear flow is zero at
points (a) and (b).



Consider cell (1): (Refer to Table A19.6,
Columns 10 and 11)


Area of cell (1) = 83.5 sq. in.

g~ = [_1] 2A~ G q Lit + Z q~ Lit + t; q2 L/~


g~ = 2 X [1] 83.5 ~ + 1278 q~    - 230 qJ, whence


g~ = 7.65 q~    - 1.378 q2-    - - - - - - - (a)


For cell (2):


Area of cell (2) = 461.5 sq. in.

A19.22 ANALYSIS OF WING STRUCTURES



Q" = 2 x 461.5 1 [733050   - 230 q~ + 2469 qJ


Q" = 794 - .2495 q~ + 2.678 q" - (b)


For continuity Q~ must equal Q", hence
equating (a) and (b):


7.899 q~   - 4.056 q" - 794 = 0   - (c)


For equilibrium the summation of all moments in the plane of the cross-section about the
section (e.g.) must be equal to zero, or


Z M c • g • = 0


The moment of the external loads about the
section c.g. is the same as in previous problem.


= 41800 in. lb.
M external forces


The induced moment due to the in plane
components of the flange axial loads is likewise
the same as in previous problem (see Table
A19.5) •


M 1 d = 4936 in.lb.
due to flange oa s


The torsional moment due to the static
shear flow from Column (7) of Table A19.6 equals
256060 in. lb. The torque due to the unknown
constant shear flows of q~ and q" is equal to
twice the enclosed area of each cell times the
shear flow in that cell, whence


M( due to q~ and q" )=2X83.5q~ +2x461.6 q"
= 167 q 1 + 923 q a


Therefore ZM c •g • = 167 q~ + 923 q" +
302796 = 0            - - (d)


Solving equations (c) and (d), we obtain,


q~ = -62.8 lb./in., q" = -317 lb./in.


These values are listed in columns (12) and (13)
of Table A19.6. The final or resultant shear
flow qr on any sheet panel equals the sum of
q ~ q, + q". The results are shown in column
(14) of Table A19.6. Fig. A19.32 shows the
potted shear flow pattern. Comparing this
figure with Fig. A19.30 shows the effect of
adding the leading edge cell to the single cell
of the previous problem.



A19.15 Bending Strength of Thick Skin - Wing Section


Figs. i and k of Fig. A19.3 illustrate
approximate shapes for airfoils of supersonic
aircraft. Such airfoils have relatively low
thickness ratios and since supersonic military
aircraft have comparatively high wing loadings,
it is necessary to go to thick skin in order to
resist the wing bending moments efficiently.
The ultimate compressive stress of such structures can be made rather uniform and occurring
at stresses considerably above the yield point
of the material. Since structures must carry
the design,loads without failure, it is necessary to be able to calculate the ultimate bending resistance of such a wing section if the
margin of safety is to be given for various
load conditions.


The question of the ultimate bending
resistance of beam sections that fail at stresses
beyond the elastic stress range is treated in
Article A13.10 and example problem 7 of Chapter
A13 and should be studied again before proceeding with the following example problem.


A19.16 Example Problem


To illustrate the procedure of Art. A13.10,
a portion of a thick skin wing section as
illustrated in Fig. A19.34 will be considered.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-428-0.png)


Fig. A19.34


For simplicity the section has been drawn
symmetrical about the x-x axis. The material
is aluminum alloy. In this problem the
material stress-strain curves will be assumed
the same in both tension and compression. The
problem is to determine the margin of safety
for this beam section when subjected to a
design bending moment Mx = 1,850,000 in. lb.


SOLUTION:


Since it is desirable to use the beam
formula ab = Mxz/Ix, it is necessary to obtain
a modified beam section to correct for the nonlinear stress-strain relationship since the
give structure will fail under stresses in the
inelastic zone. The maximum compressive stress
at surface of beam will be assumed at 50000 psi.
This value could be calculated from a consider

**A19.24** **ANALYSIS** **OF** **WING** **STRUCTURES**



(46900/49900) - 1 **=** **-.06.** The elastic theory
thus gives a margin of safety 10 percent less
than the strength given when true stress-strain
or non-linear relationship is used.


If the Slli~e comparison was made for bending
about Z axis of this same beam section the
difference would be considerably more than 10
percent as more beam area is acting in the
region of greater discrepancy between curves A
and **B.**


**A19.** **17** **Application to** **Practical** **Wing Section**


A practical wing section involves these
facts: - (1) The section is unsymmetrical;
(2) external load planes change their direction
under different flight conditions; (3) the
material stress-strain curves are different in
tension and compression in the inelastic range.


Since the stress analyst must determine
critical margins of safety for many conditions,
it would be convenient to have an interaction
curve involving Mx and Mz bending moments which
would cause failure of the wing section. This
interaction curve could be obtained as follows:

(1) Choose a neutral axis direction and its
location.


(2) Assuming that plane sections remain plane,
and taking the maximum strain as that
causing failure of the compressive flange,
use the stress-strain curve to determine
the longitudinal stress and then the
internal load on each element of the crosssection. A check on the location of the
assumed neutral axis is that the total
compression on cross-section must equal
total tension. Since the location was
assumed or guessed, the neutral axis must
be moved parallel to itself to another
location and repeated until the above
check is obtained.


(3) Find the internal resisting moment about
the neutral axis and an axis normal to the
neutral axes. Resolve these moments into
moments about x and z axes or Mx and **M** **z .**
These resulting values of Mx and Mz are
bending moments which acting together will
cause failure of the wing in bending.


(4) Repeat steps 1, 2 and 3 for several other
directions for a neutral axis which results
will give additional combinations of Mx
and Mz moments to cause wing failure. Thus
an interaction curve involving values of
Mx and Mz which cause failure of wing in
bending is obtained and thus the margin of
safety for any design condition is readily
obtainable.



**A19.18** **Shear Lag** **Influences**


In the beam theory, the assumption is made
that plane sections remain plane after bending.
In a beam involving sheet and stringer panels,
this assumption means that the sheet panels
have infinite shearing rigidity, which of course
is not true as shearing stresses produce shearing strains. The effect of sheet panel shear
strains is to cause some stringers to resist
less axial load than those calculated by beam
theory. This decreased effectiveness of
stringers is referred to as "shear lag" effect,
since some stringers tend to lag back from the
position they would take if plane sections remain plane after bending.


In general, the shear lag effect in sheetstringer structures is not appreciable except
for the following situations: 

(1) Cutouts which cause one or more stringers
to be discontinued.


(2) Large abrupt changes in external load
applications.


(3) Abrupt changes in stringer areas.


In Chapters A7 and AS, strains due to
shearing stresses were considered in solving
for distortions and stresses in structures involving sheet-stringer construction. Even in
these so-called rigorous methods, simplifying
assl®ptions must be made as for example, shear
stress is constant over a particular sheet
panel and estimates of the modulus of rigidity
for sheet panels under a varying state of
buckling must be made. The number of stringers
and sheet panels in a normal wing is large,
thus the structure is statically indeterminate
to many degrees and solutions necessitate the
use of high speed computors. Before such
analyses can be made, the size and thickness of
each structural part must be known, thus rapid
approximate methods of stress analysis are
desirable in obtaining accurate preliminary
sizes to use in the more rigorous elastic
analysis.


To illustrate the shear lag problem in its
simplest state, consider the three stringersheet panel unit of Fig. A19.36. The three
stringers are supported rigidly at B and equal
loads P are applied to the two edge stringers
labeled (1) at point (A). The center stringer
(2) has zero axial load at (A), but as end B is
approached, the sheet panels transfer some of
the load P to the center stringer by shear
stresses in the sheet. At the support points B
the transfer of load from side stringers to
center stringer is such as to make the load in
all three stringers approximately equal or
equal to 2P/3.

equals 3b. At beam section 2-2 stringers (5)
and (7) have become effective since they intersect triangle at points (a) on section 2-2. At
section 3-3 point c, stringer (6) becomes fUlly
effective.


To handle shear lag effect in a practical
wing problem another column would be inserted
in Table A19.1 between columns (3) and (4) to
take care of the shear lag effect. The shear
lag effectiveness factor which we will call R
would equal the effectiveness obtained from a
triangle such as illustrated in Fig. A19.38.


For example, the shear lag factor R at
beam section 1-1 in Fig. A19.38 would be zero
for stringers (5), (6) and (7) and one for all
other stringers. At beam section 2-2 stringers
(5) and (7) have a factor R = 1.0 since they
are fUlly effective at points (a). Stringer
(6) is only 50 percent effective since section
2-2 is halfway from section 1-1 to point (c),
thus R = 0.5 for stringer (6). At beam section
3-3, stringer (6) becomes fully effective and
thus R = 1.0 for all stringers. The final
modified stringer area (A) in column (4) of
Table A19.1 would then equal the true stringer
area plus its effective skin times the factors
KR. The procedure from this point would be the
same as discussed before. Thus shear lag approximations can be handled qUite easily by
modifying the stringer areas. Using these
modified stringer areas, the true total loads
in the stringers are obtained. The true stresses
equal these loads divided by the true stringer
area, not the modified area.


A19.20 Approximate Shear Lag Effect in Beam Regions
where Large Concentrated Loads are Applied.


Wing and fuselage structures are often reqUired to resist large concentrated forces as
for example power plant reactions, landing gear
reactions, etc. To illustrate, Fig. A19.39
represents a landing condition, with vertical
load. The wing is a box beam with 7 stringers

The theoretical load in center stringer
can be calculated by methods of Chapter A7 and
AS, and the results would give the solid curve
of Fig. A19.37. To simplify the solution, it
,is common practice to aSSlli~e the load distribution in the center stringer to vary according
to the dashed curve in Fig. A19.37 which
indicates that in a distance 3b, the load 2P
is equalized between the three stringers.

A19.26 ANALYSIS OF WING STRUCTURES



and flange members. Fig. (a) shows the bending
moment diagram due to the landing gear reaction
alone. The internal resistance to this bending
moment cannot be uniform on a beam section
adjacent to section A-A because of the shear
strain in the sheet panels or what is called
shear lag effect. To approximate this stringer
effectiveness, a shear lag triangle of length
3b is assumed, and the same procedure as
discussed in the previous article on cut-outs
is used in finding the longitudinal stresses.
It should be understood that the bending moments
due to the distributed forces on the wing such
as air loads and dead weight inertia loads are
not included in the shear lag considerations,
only the forces that are applied at concentrated
points on the structure and must be distributed
into the beam. A side load on the gear or
power plant would produce a localized couple
plus an axial force besides a shear force as in
Fig. A19.39. The resistance to this couple and
axial force would likewise be based on the
effectiveness triangle in Fig. A19.39.


A19.21 Approximation of Shear Lag Effect for Sudden
Change in Stringer Area


stringers of one size are often spliced to
stringers of smaller size thus creating a discontinuity because of the sudden change in
stringer area.


Fig. A19.40 shows the stringer arrangement
in a typical sheet-stringer wing. Stringer B
is spliced at point indicated. The stringer
area As is decreased suddenly by splicing into
a stringer with less area A 1 •

To approximate the shear lag effect,
assume the area of stringer B at splice point
to be the average area of the two sides or

(A 1 + As )/2. This average area is then assumed
to taper to As and A 1 at a distance 3b from the
splice point. The shear lag effectiveness
factor R will therefore be greater than 1.0 on
the side toward the smaller stringer A, and
less than one on the side toward the stringer
with the greater area As, since the average
area was used for the splice point.

**CHAPTER** Azo

**INTRODUCTION** **TO** **FUSELAGE** **STRESS** **ANALYSIS**



A20.1 General. In general the purpose of an airplane is to transport a commercial payload or a
military useful load. The commercial payload
of a modern airliner may be 100 or more passengers and their baggage. These passengers
must be transported safely and comfortably.
For example, an airliner flies at high altitudes
where temperatures may be far below zero and
where the air density is such as not to sustain
human life. These facts mean that the body
which carries the passengers must be heated,
ventilated and pressurized to provide the
necessary safety. Air travel must be acceptable
to the passengers, thus the airplane body must
shield the passengers from excessive noise and
vibration, and furthermore efficient, restful
and attractive furnishings must be provided to
make travel enroute comfortable and enjoyable.
The portion of the airplane which houses the
passengers on payload is referred to as the
fuselage. Fuselages vary greatly in size and
configuration. For exam)le, the fuselage of a
supersonic military airplane may house only one
passenger, the pilot, the remainder of the
fuselage interior space being used to house the
power plant, to provide retracting space for
landing gear, and to house the many mechanical
and electronic installations which are necessary
to fly the airplane and carry out the various
operations for which the airplane was designed
to accomplish. Many groups of engineers with
various backgrounds of training and experience
are therefore concerned with the design of the
fuselage. The structures engineer plays a very
important part because he is responsible for
the strength, rigidity and light weight of the
fuselage structure.


A20.2 Loads. Basic Structure.


The wing, being the lifting body is subjected to large distributed surface air forces,
whereas the fuselage is subjected to relatively
small surface air forces. The fuselage is subjected to large concentrated forces such as the
wing reactions, landing gear reactions, empennage reactions, etc. In addition the fuselage
houses many items of various sizes and weights
which therefore SUbject the fuselage to large
inertia forces. In addition, because of high
altitude flight, the fuselage must withstand
internal pressures, and to handle these internal
pressures efficiently requires a circular crosssection or a combination of circular elements.


The student should refer to Chapter A4 for
further discussion of loads on aircraft and also



to Chapter A5, where exanple calculations of
fuselage shears and moments are presented.


The basic fuselage structure is essentiall=
a single cell thin walled tube with many transverse franes or rings and longitudinal stringerr
to provide a combined structure which can absorl
and transmit the many concentrated and distributed applied forces safely and efficiently.
The fuselage is essentially a bean structure
subjected to bending, torsional and axial
forces. The ideal fuselage structure would be
one free of cut-outs or discontinuities, however a practical fuselage must have many cutouts. Fig. (a) shows the basic interior fuselage structure of a small airplane with skin
removed. It consists of transverse frames and
longitudinal stringers. Photographs 1, 2 and 3
illustrate fuselage construction of late model
large aircraft.

A20.3 Stress Analysis Methods. Effective CrossSection.


It is common practice to use the simplified
beam theory in calculating the stresses in the
skin and stringers of a fuselage structure. If
the fuselage is pressurized, the stresses in the
skin due to this internal pressure must be added
to the stresses which resist the flight loads.
In wings the skin in the middle region of the
airfoil is relatively flat and thus the skin is
usually considered as made up of flat sheet
panels. In fuselages, however, the skin is
curved and curved sheet panels have a higher
critical compressive buckling stress than flat
panels of the same size and thickness. In
small airplanes, the radius of curvature of the
fuselage skin is relatively small and thus the
additional buckling strength due to this curvature may be appreciable. A simple procedure of
approximately including the effect of sheet
curvature will now be explained.


Fig. A20.l illustrates a distributed
stringer type of fuselage section. Assume that
external loads are applied which produce bending
of the beam about the Y axis With compression on
the upper portion of the cell.



A20.3


(1) A small width of sheet w. on each side of
the attachment line of skin to stringer is
considered as carrying the same c6mpressive
stress as the stringer, as was discussed in
Chapter A19. These effective sheet Widths
w. are shown as the blackened elements adjacent to the stringers on the compressive
side in Fig. A20.l.


(2) The remainder of the curved sheet between
stringers, namely, b- (w. + we) carries a
maximum compressive stress ocr = .3 E t/r.
This value for ocr is conservative. E is
the modulus of elasticity of the skin
material, t the skin thickness, and r the
radius of curvature of the skin. These
curved sheet elements are shown by the
hatched skin lengths in Fig. A20.1.


Since the thin curved skin between the
stringers normally buckles under a compressive
stress far below the buckling strength of the
stringers, the curved sheet is treated as an
element With varying effective thickness which
depends on the ratio of the curved sheet buckling stress ocr to the bending stress 0b existing at that point for bending of the fuselage
section. Hence the effective sheet thickness
for the curved sheet panels can be written,


                   - - - - (1)


or an effective area can be written


                      - -                       -                       - (2)


where b' is the width of curved sheet between
the effective sheet widths w., we' etc. (See
Fig. A20.l).


To illustrate this approach in obtaining
the effective cross-section of a fuselage
section, an example problem will be presented.
The example problem will be broadened to some
extent for the purpose of introducing the student to design procedure.


A20.4 Example Problem.


Let it be required to determine the stringer
arrangement for the approximate elliptical
shaped fuselage section shown in Fig. A20.2.


The following data will be assumed: 

Design bending moment about y axis = 1,600,000
in. lb. (producing compression on upper portion).
Zee stringers, one inch deep and with an area
equal to 0.12 sq. in. shall be used.
The ultimate compressive strength of the zee
stringer plus its effective skin and a length
equal to fuselage frame spacing is assumed to
be 32000 psi. The skin thickness is .032 and
all material is (2024) aluminum alloy with E =
10,300,000 psi. The fuselage stringers are to
be symmetrical about section center lines.

y



Up to the point of buckling of the curved sheet
between the skin stringers, all the material in
the beam section can be considered fUlly effective and the bending stresses can be computed
by the general flexure formula crt = Mz/Iy,
where Iy is the centroidal moment of inertia of
the entire section. When a bending compression
stress is reached which causes the curved sheet
between stringers to buckle, are-arrangement
takes place in the stress distribution on the
section as a whole. Theory as well as experimental results indicate that the Ultimate compressive strength of a curved she~t With edge
stringers can be approximated by the following
two assumptions.

19



which equals a width of .975/.032 = 30.5 sheet
thicknesses. Since the bending stress decreases
to zero as the neutral axis is approached, and
since the curved sheet between the Z stringers
can carry loads up to its buckling strength, a
preliminary value of effective width w = 40t
will be assumed acting with each stringer. Thus
total area of stringer plus effective skin
equals 0.12 + 40 x .032 [2] = 0.16 sq. in. The
number of stringers required is therefore 2.00/
**0.16** **=** **12.**


Fig. A20,2 shows how the stringers were
placed to give 12 stringers on the top half.
Since the skin on the lower half is in tension
and therefore fUlly effective, the neutral axis
will fall below the center line and thus the
two stringers on the center line will be considered as part of the required 12 stringers.
A fuselage cross-section has now been obtained.
The desired final result is that the maximum
compressive stress will be near but not over
32000 psi. The procedure from this point is
still a trial and error process since the
effective sheet on the compressive side depends
on the ma~nitude of the compressive bending
stress which in turn is influenced by the amount
of effective sheet and the buckling load carried
by the curved sheet.


Using the preliminary stringer arrangement
of Fig. A20,2, Tables A20.1 and A20.2 give the
calculation of the effective moment of inertia

of the section about the horizontal neutral
axis, Table A20.1 deals with the stringers and
the effective sheet elements and Table A20.2

deals with the curved buckled sheet elements.


In the trial No.1, the following assumptions are made:


(1) A width of 30 thicknesses of skin act
with each stringer on the upper or compressive
side.


(2) The area of the curved sheet between
the effective sheet widths as found in (1) is
modified to give an effective area by multiplying by a K factor of Ocr/ob' where ocr is
the buckling compressive stress and 0b is the
bending stress at the center of the curved sheet
element assuming 32000 at the extreme upper
fiber of the beam section and zero at the horizontal center line, with linear variation in
between these points.


NOTE: Since the entire skin on the lower half
is effective, a more logical assumption would
be to guess at the location of the neutral axis
and use a variation of 0b between the neutral
axis and the extreme fiber. This approach will
not be used in this example.

Location of stringers

above Y' -Y' .



Solution:


The first thing to do is to determine approximately how many Z stringers will be reqUired so that a section can be obtained to
work with. Since the internal resisting moment must equal the external bending moment, one
can guess at the internal resisting couple in
terms of total compressive flange stress and an
effective internal couple arm.


For elliptical and circular sections with
distributed flange material, the approximate
effective resisting arm of the internal couple
can be taken as 0.75 times the height h, and
the average tension or compressive stress as
2/3 the maximum stress. Thus equating the
external bending moment to the internal resisting moment an approximate total area Ac for the
compressive side of the fuselage section can be
obtained.


My = Ac (.67 0b)(' 75 h), whence,


1,600,000
A c = .75x50x.67x32000 **=** **2.0** **sq** .• **in**


Part of this total area is provided by the
effective skin area. The effective width to
use with each rivet line equals w = ct )E/Ost.
We will take C = 1.7 which is a commonly used
value.

A20.6 FUSELAGE STRESS ANALYSIS



Due to the s~~etry of the section, Tables
A20.1 and A20.2 give calculations for only onehalf of the material, thus the results are
multiplied by two. General explanatory notes
are given below each table.


The results of trial No. 1 give a neutral
axis 3.38" below the center line and a moment of
inertia of 1470 in. [4 ] - In Trial No.2, the effective sheet widths are based on the moment of
inertia of 1470. The results of trial No.2
give a moment of inertia of 1489 in. [4] with a
neutral axis .135" above the first location. If
a third trial were used, making use of the 1489
moment of inertia, the change would be qUite
small since the effect of a small change in
stress on the effective sheet width is negligible.


The compressive stress on stringer No. 2
using the resulting moment of inertia and
neutral axis location, therefore becomes


ab = MyZ/Iy = 1,600,000x27.45/1489 =29,500
psi


The allowable stress was 32000, hence the
margin of safety is (32000/29500) - 1 = .08 or
eight percent. If a smaller margin of safety
was desired some material would be eliminated
and the calculations of Tables A20.1 and A20.2
would be repeated.


Calculation of Shear Stress in Skin at Neutral
Axis


The equation for the shear flow q at some
point on the skin is,


q qo    - Vz Zaz - -'    - - - - - - - - - - (3)
I
y



qo + I V z Zaz
y

= 0 + (V 1489 [z ] ) 1 9. 67 = .0132 Vz lb. in. /


The shear stress ~ = q/t = .0132 V z /.032 = .413
V z


The average shear stress on the section would
be ~av' = V z /2ht = V z /2x50x.032 = .312 V z ·


Thus for this shape of cross-section and
stringer arrangement the maximum shear stress
is .413/.312 times the average shear stress or
approximately 4/3 times as large.


The procedure as given above is qUite conservative relative to the true or actual margin
of safety, because a linear variation of stress
with strain has been assumed and failure of the
section is assumed to occur when the most remote
stringer reaches its Ultimate compressive stress.
Actually in a static test of a fuselage to
destruction, the fuselage section as a whole
will not collapse when one stringer buckles,
but will continue to take increasing load until
other stringers have reached their ultimate
strength. Furthermore, in a typical fuselage
structure, stringers of various sizes, shapes
and therefore different compressive strengths
are used, and thus to obtain a better measure
of the ultimate strength of a fuselage section,
modifications in stress procedures are made to
measure stringer effectiveness. This SUbject
was discussed in some detail in Arts. 11 and 12
of Chapter A19. To illustrate stringer effectiveness in fuselage bending stress analysis, a
simple example problem will be presented.


A20. 5 Ultimate Bending Strength of Fuselage Section.
Example Calculation.


Fig. A20.3 shows the cross-section of a
circular fuselage. The Z stringers are arranged
symmetrically with respect to the center line
Z and X axes.



Due to symmetry of cross-section about the Z
axis the shear flow qo is zero at a point on
the center line Z axis. The summation of the
term az between a point on the Z axis and the
neutral axis is given in Table A20.3. The
values of areas (a) and arms (z) are taken
from Tables A20.1 and A20.2.



Three sizes of Z stringers are used as

from Tables A20.1 and A20.2.

A20.7


Since the location of the neutral axis is
unknown, a location will be assumed, namely, 7
inches below the center line axis as shown in
Fig. A20.3. The entire calculations for determining the effective moment of inertia can best
be done in Table form, as shown in Table A20.4.
Due to symmetry about the Z axis only one-half
of the structure need be considered since the
results can be multiplied by two.


Column (1) lists the stringer numbers
relative to location and Column (2) according
to types S1.' 8 2 and S". Column (3) gives the
stringer area. On the tension or lower side of
the section, the skin is all effective and that
area of skin halfway to each adjacent stringer
is assumed to act with stringers numbered 9 to
13 and this skin area is recorded in Column (5) •
On the compressive side the skin is only
partially effective. The effective width w for
each stringer rivet line depends on the stringer
stress. We will take the effective width w =
1.9t VE!OST. The effective area Ae will then
equal wt. These effective skin areas are recorded in Column (5). In solving this equation
the stringer stress 08T has been taken as -36500
psi on stringer number (1), and then varying
linearly to zero at the neutral axis as indicated in Column (4). This assumption is not
true but accurate enough to obtain effective
skin areas. To illustrate, consider stringer
number (1). The effective area Ae equals wt [2] =
1.9 x .032 [2] (10,300,000/36500)i = .032 sq. in.
Column (6) gives the sum of the stringer and
effective skin areas or As + Ae .


In this example problem, the effectiveness
of the curved sheet panels between the sheet
effective widths will be neglected since its influence is small. It could be inclUded as illustrated in the previous example problem.
Column (7) lists the distances from the assumed
neutral axis to the centroid of each stringerskin unit. We now assume that plane sections
remain plane or a linear strain variation.
Referring to Fig. A20.5, it is noticed that when
a unit strain of .006 is obtained in stringer
81. type the compressive stress is 36500, which
represents its ultimate stress. Stringer (1)
is of 81. type and is located farthest from
the neutral axis. Sub. Fig. (a) of Fig. A20.3
shows the strain diagram with .006 at stringer
(1) and varying as a straight line to zero at
the neutral axis. Column (8) of Table A20.4
records the unit strain at each stringer centroid. The true stress at each stringer point
due to these strain values is read from the
curves on Fig. A20.5 and recorded in column (9)
of the Table. It should be noted that stringer
(3) although closer to the neutral axis than
stringer (1) carries a higher stress than
stringer (1). This is possible because when
stringer (1) reaches its maximum-stress, it
bends but continues to hold the same stress with

using the modified areas of Table A20.4, the
true stringer areas must be used to find the
true stringer loads, which must be used in the
shear flow analysis.


A20.6 Shear Flow Analysis for Fuselage Structures


The shear flow analysis can be made once
the effective cross-sections of the fuselage
are obtained. The procedure is the same as was
illustrated for wing structures in Chapter A19.
To illustrate, two example problems will be
presented.



A20.9


Iy = (15 [2] x .1 x 2) + (13.86 [2] + 10.61 [2] + 5.74 [2] ).1


x 4 = 180 in. [4]


Table A20.5 gives the necessary calculations
for determining the flange bending stresses and
the net total shear load to be taken by the cell
skin. Since the cell is tapered, the stringers
have a z component, thus the stringer axial
loads help resist the external shear load. The
summation of column (8) of Table A20.5 gives
-333.4 lb. for a summation for half the fuselage
section.



Example Problem 1. Symmetrical Tapered Section. Hence, net web shear at station 0 equals:



Fig. A20.6 shows a portion of a tapered
circular shaped fuselage structure that might
be representative of the rear portion of a
fuselage for a small airplane. Since this
example is only for the purpose of illustrating
shear flow analysis, it will be assumed that
the 16 stringers are the only effective material. In an actual stress analysis, the effective cross-section would have to be used as
illustrated in previous articles A20.3 to A20.5.


The problem will be to determine the
stringer stresses and the skin shear flow stress
system at Station (0) under a given load system
at Station (150) as shown in Fig. A20.6.


Solution No. 1 - Solution by Considering Beam Properties
at Only One Section.


If the change in longitudinal stringer or
flange material is fairly uniform this method
can be used with little error in the resulting
shear flow stresses.


Moment of inertia of section at station (0)
about centroidal Y axis:



Due to symmetry of the section about the Z
axis, the flexural shear flow in the web at the
center line is zero. Therefore, qo will be taken
as zero and the summation in equation (A) will



V Web = v ext   - + Vnange = 2000 + (2 x -333.4)


**=** **1333.2** **lb.**


The results in this particular problem show
that at station 0 the flange stringer system resists one third of the external shear load. At
station 150 the web system will resist the entire external shear load of 2000 lb. since the
load in the stringers is zero.


In actual design the net web shear should
be used since in many cases it will decrease
the sheet thickness required one or more gauges.

The torsional moment T about the centroid
of the section at station (0) equals 5 x 2000 ::
10000 in. lb. (clockwise when looking toward
station 150). Due to the symmetry of the section at station 0, the in-plane components of
the stringer loads produce zero moment about
the section centroid.

Solution No.2. Shear Flow by Change in Stringer Loads
Between Adjacent Stations. 6P Method.
The shear flow will be calculated by considering the change in the axial load in the
longitUdinal stringers between fuselage sections at stations (0) and (30).


Fig. A20.8 shows the beam section at station 30, the stringer areas being the same as
at station 0, but the section as a whole is
smaller due to the taper of the cell.

same as illustrated for wing structures in
Chapter A19.


Comparing the results of column 13 With the
flexural shear flow as found by solution No.1,
we find the second solution gives a maximum
shear flow of 28.95 lb./in. against a value of

deals with the properties at only one section
and this cannot include the effects of change

second method is recommended for practical
analysis procedure.


Since the section is symmetrical, there are
no moments induced by the in-plane components of
the stringer forces at station O.


The torsional shear flow forces are the
same as in solution method No. 1 and these are
added to the values of column 13 of Table A20.6
and give a pattern similar to Fig. A20.7.


A20.7 Example Problem. Tapered Circular Fuselage
with Unsymmetrical Stringer Areas.


Fuselage cross-sections are seldom all symmetrical relative to stringer and skin areas
because the practical fuselage has cut-outs such
as doors, etc. To illustrate the unsymmetrical
case a simplified case will be presented.


Fig. A20.9 shows a portion of a tapered
fuselage. The stringer areas are such as to
make the cross-sections unsymmetrical relative
to bending material. Again for simplicity, we



will assume the stringers are the only effective
material. In actual design practice the effectiveness of the skin and each stringer would have
to be considered as explained in Articles A20.4
and 5.


The problem will be to determine the
stringer stresses and the skin shear flow values at station (0) due to the given external
loads of Pz = 4000 lb., Py = 1000 lb. and Px =
1500 acting at station (150) as shown in Fig.
A20.9.


SOLUTION:


Since we choose to use the liP method in
finding the shear flow system at station (0),
we will find the stringer loads at two stations,
namely, station (0) and station (30). The first
step is to find the moment of inertia of each
fuselage section about centroidal z and y axes
and the product of inertia about these axes.
Table A20.7 (Columns 1 to 11) gives the calculations of the section properties for station

The skin stringers are located symmetrically with respect to the
Section at Station 0 centerline axes, however the stringer areas as given in ( ) on
the figure are not symmetrical with these axes. It is assumed in this problem that
the stringers taper uniformly between the values as given for station 0 and 150.
The cell would of course have interior transverse frames which are not shown on the
figure.

the calculations for station (30).


Before the bending and shear stresses can
be calculated, the external bending moments,
shears and normal forces at stations (0) and (30)
must be known.

The shears at station (0) are Vz = Pz =
4000 lb. and Vy = Py = -1000 lb.


The normal load Pn at station (0) referred
to centroid of section equals ZP x = -1500 lb.


In a similar manner, the values at station

where large concentrated loads are applied can
be determined by the procedure given in Articles
18 to 20 of Chapter A19. A more rigorous
analysis can be made by the application of the
basic theory as ~iven in Chapter A8.


The problem of shell stresses due to internal pressures is presented in Chapter A16.
The strength design of the fUselage skin involves a question of combined stresses. The
broad problem of the strength design of structural elements and their connections under all
types of stress conditions is covered in Volume
II.

A20. 10 Secondary Stresses in Fuselage Stringers and Rings.


The stresses that are found in the
stringers or longerons of a typical fuselage by
use of the modified beam theory or by the more
rigorous theory of Chapter AS, are referred to
as primary stresses. Because of the necessity
of weight saving, most fuselage structures are
designed to permit skin buckling, which means
that shear loads in the skin are carried by
diagonal semi-tension field action. This
diagonal tension in the skin panels produces
additional stresses in the stringers and also
in the fuselage rings. These resulting stresses
are referred to as secondary stresses and must
be properly added to the primary stresses in
the strength design of the individual stringer
or ring. Chapter Cll covers the SUbject of
these secondary stresses due to diagonal semitension field action in skin panels. It is
suggested to the stUdent that after studying
Chapters A19 and A20, that Chapters C10 and Cll
be referred to in order to obtain a complete
stress picture for skin covered structures.

**CHAPTER** **A21**

**LOADS** **AND** **STRESSES** **ON** **RIBS** **AND** **FRAMES**



A21.1 Introduction. For aerodynamic reasons the
wing cantou, in the chord direction must be
maintained without appreciable rJistortion.
Unless the wing skin is quite thick, spanwise
stringers must be attached to the skin in order
to increase the bending efficiency of the wing.
Therefore to hold the skin-stringer wing surface
to contour shape and also to limit the length
of strinc\ers to an efficient coltunn compressive
stren,a;th, internal support or brace units are
reqUired. These structural units are referred
to as wing ribs. The ribs also have another
major purpose, nam81y, to act as a transfer or
distribution unit. All the loads apnlied to
th8 wina; are react8d at the wing supporting
points, thus these applied loads must be transferred into the wing cellular c'tructure composed of skin, stringers, snars, etc., anrJ then
reacted at the win': support Doints. The 3TJTJlied
loads may be only the rJistributed surface airloads which requi re relativ!31y light int8rnal
ribs to pr'ovids this carry through or transfer
requirement, to rather rugged or heavy ribs
which must absorb and transmit large concentrated applied loads such as those from landing
gear reactions, power GIant reactions and fuselage reactions. In between these two extremes
of applied load mao;nitudes are such loads as
reactions at supporting points for ailerons,
flaps, leading edge high lift units and the
many internal dead wei,:ht loads such as fuel
and military armament and other insta1l8tions.
Thus ribs can vary from a very light structure
which serves primarily as a former to a h3avy
structure which must receive and transfer loads

involving thousands of pounds.


Since the airplane control surfaces (vertical and horizontal stabilizer, etc.) are nothing
more than small size wings, internal ribs are
likewise needed in these structures.



loads into the fuselage shell such as those
from landing gear reactions, wing reactions,
tail reactions, pONer Dlant reactions, etc.
The dead wei";ht of all the payload and fixed
equipment inside the fuselan'e must be carried
to frames by other structure such as the

fuselage floor system and then transmitted to
the fuselage shell structure. Since the dead
weight must be multiplied by the design acceleration factors, these internal loads become
qUite lanse in mo!:nitude.


Another important purpose or action of ribs
and frames is to redistribute the shear at discontinuities and Dractical wings and fuselages
contain many cut-outs and openings and thus
discontinuities in the basic structural layout.

The skin-stringer construction which forms
the shell of the fusela~e likewise needs internal forming units to hold the fuselage
cross-section to contour shape, to limit the
coluJnn length of the stringers and to act as Fig. A21. 2
transfer agents of internal and externally
applied loads. Since a fuselage must usually
have clear internal space to house the payload
such as passengers in a commercial transport,
these internal fuselage units which are usually
referred to as frames are of the open or ring
type. Fuselage frames vary in size and strength
from very light former type to rugged heavy
types which must transfer large concentrated

stringer, single spar, single cell wing
structure. The rib is riveted, or spot-welded,
or glued to the skin along it boundary. Fig.
2 shows the same leading edge cell but with
spanwise corruga~ions on the top skin and
stringers on the bottom. On the top the rib
flange rests below the corrugations, whereas
the stringers on the bottom pass through cutouts in the rib. Fig. 3 illustrates the general type of sheet metal rib that can be
qUickly made by use of large presses and rubber
dies. Figs. 4 and 5 illustrate rib types for
middle portion of wing section. The rib
flanges may rest below stringers or be notched
for allowing stringers to pass through. Ribs
that are sUbjected to considerable torsional
forces in the plane of the rib should have some
shear ties to the skin. For ribs that rest

below~tringers this shear tie can be made by
a few sheet metal angle clips as illustrated in
Fig. 5. Fig. A21.7 shows an artist's drawing
of the wing structure of the Beechcraft Bonanza
commercial airplane. It should be noticed that
various types and shapes of ribs and formers
are required in airplane design. Photographs
A21.1 to 3 illustrate typical rib construction
in various type aircraft, both large and small.
Since ribs compose an appreciable part of the
wing structural weight, it is important that
they be made as light as safety permits and
also be efficient relative to cost of fabrication and assembly. Rib development and design
involves considerable static testing to verify
and assist the theoretical analysis and design.


A21. 3 Distribution of Concentrated Loads to Thin

Sheet Panels.


In Art. A21.1 it was brought out that ribs



were used to transmit external loads into the
wing cellular beam structure. Concentrated
external loads must be distributed to the rib

before the rib can transfer the load to the
wing beam structure. In other words, a concentrated load applied directly to the edge of
a thin sheet would cause sheet to buckle or
cripple under the localized stress. Thus a
structural element usually called a web stiffener or a web flan~e is fastened to the web and
the concentrated load goes into the stiffener
which in turn transfers the load to the web.
To ~et the load into the stiffener usually requires an end fitting. In general the distributed air loads on the wing surface are usually
of such magnitude that the loads can be distributed to rib web by direct bearing of flange
normal to edge of rib web without causing local
buckling, thus stiffeners are usually not
needed to transfer air pressures to wing ribs.


EXAMPLE PROBLEM ILLUSTRATING TRANSFER OF CONCENTRATED LOAD TO SHEET **PANEL.**


Fig. A21.8 shows a cantilever beam composed of 2 flanges and a web. A concentrated
load of 1000 lb. is applied at point (A) in the
direction shown. Another concentrated load of
1000 lb. is applied at point (E) as shown.


To distribute the load of 1000 lb. at (A),
a horizontal stiffener (AB) and a vertical
stiffener (CAD) are added as shown. A fitting
would be required at (A) which would be attached
to both stiffeners. The horizontal component
of the 1000 lb. load which equals 800 lb. is
taken by the stiffener (AB) and the vertical
component which equals 600 lb. is taken by the

would be transferred to stiffener EF through
fitting at E. The problem is to find the shear
flows in the web panels, the stiffener loads
and the beam flange loads.



Figs. A21.9 and A21.10 show free bodies of that

The shear flows on web panels (1) and (2)
will be computed treating each comDonent of
the 1000 lb. load as acting separately and the
results added to give the final shear flow.

Referring to Fig. A21.10, Solving equations (1) and (2) gives,



L:I1E = 600 x 10 - 12 x 10q 1. = 0, whence q 1. =
50 lb. in.


L:F): = -50 x 10 + 10q2 = 0, whence q 2 =
50 Ib./in.


Combining the two shear flows for the two loads,


q:l. = 20 + 50 = 70 Ib./in.


50 = 10 Ib./in.


Fig. A21.11 shows the results. Fig.
A21.12 shows stiffener AB as a free body, and
Fig. A21.13 the axial load diav,ram on stiffener
AB, which comes directly from Fig. A21.11 by
starting at one end and adding the shear flows.



q1. = 70 Ib./in., q2 = 10 Ib.lin., which
checks first solution.


The shear flow q3 in web panel (3) is obtained by considering stiffener EBF as a free
body, see Fig. A21.16.


ZF y = 12q3 + 10 x 3 - 9 x 70


            - 1000 = 0


whence, q3 = 133.33 Ib./in.


The shear flow q3
could also be found by
treating entire beam to

and P x are distributed to the web panels by
using three stiffeners S~, S2 and S3 intersecting at (0).


In cases where a load must be applied
normal to the web panel, the stiffener must be
designed strong enough or transfer the load in
bending to adjacent webs.


In this chapter, the webs ar~ assumed to
resist pure shear along their boundaries. In
most practical thin web structures, the webs
will buckle under the compressive stresses due
to shear stresses and thus produce tensile

f~eld stresses in addition to the shear
stresses. The sUbject of tension field beams
is discussed in detail in Volume II. In general the additional stresses due to tension
field action can be superimposed on those
found for the non-buckling case as explained
in this chapter.


STRESSES IN WING RIBS


A21. 4 Rib for Single Cell 2 Flange Beam.


Fig. A21.20 illustrates a rib in a 2flange single cell leading edge type of beam.
Assume that the air-load on the trailing edge
portion (not shown in the figure) produces a
couple reaction P and a shear reaction R as
shown. These loads are distributed to the cell
walls by the rib which is fastened continuously
to the cell walls. Let q = shear flow per
inch on rib perimeter which is necessary to
hold rib in equilibrium under the given loads
P and R.


Taking moments about some point such as (1)
of all forces in the plane of the rib:


ZM~ = -Ph + 2Aq = 0


hence



![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-456-0.png)

With q known the shear and bending moment
at various sections along the rib can be determined. For example, consider the section at B-B
in Fig. A21.20. Fig. A21.21 shows a free body
of the portion forward of this section.


The bending moment at section B-B equals:


MB = 2qA~ where A~ is the area of the
shaded portion.


Let Fx equal the horizontal component of
the flange load at this section.


Fig. A21. 21

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-456-3.png)


The true upper flange load Fu = Fx/cOS Q~
and the lower flange load equals FL = Fx/cos Q2.


The vertical shear on the rib web at B-B
equals the vertical component of the shear flow
q minus the vertical components of the flange
loads. Hence


V web = q a - F x tan
= q a - 2 q a A~


Illustrative Problem


The rib in the leading edge portion of the
wing as illustrated in Fig. A21.22 will be
analyzed.



q = Ph/2A. (A = enclosed area of cell) A distributed external load as shown will
be assumed.


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-457-full.png)

Solution:


The total air load aft of beam = 8 x 40/2 =
160 lb. The arm to its c.g. location from the
beam equals 40/3 = 13.33". Hence the reactions
at the beam flange points Bue to the loads on
the trailing edge portion equals:


P = 160 x 13.33/10 = 213.2 lb. (See Fig.
A21.23)


Shear reaction Vr = 160 lb.


w = 8 lb. /in.

A21. 5 Stresses in Rib for 3 Stringer Single
Cell Beam.


Fig. A21.25 shows a rib that fits into a
single cell beam with 3 stringers labeled (a),
(b) and (c). An external load is applied at
point (a) whose components are 5000 and 3000
Ibs. as shown. Additional reactions from a
trailinG edGe rib are shown at points (b) and
(c). A vertical stiffener ad is necessary to
distribute the load of 5000 lb. at (a). The
following values will be determined: 

(1) Rib web shear loads on each side of stiffener ad.


(2) Rib flange load at section ad.


(3) Rib flange and web load at section just
to left of line bc.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-457-2.png)


SOLUTION. It will be assumed that the 3 stringers develop the entire wing beam bending resistance, thus the wing shear flow is constant between the stringers. The wing rib is riveted
to the wing skin and thus the edge forces on
the rib boundary will be assumed to be the same
as the shear flow distribution. In other words,
the three shear flows Gadc' qba and qcb hold the
external loads in equilibrium. The sense of
these 3 unknown shear flows will be assumed as
shown in Fig. A21.25.


To find Gadc' take moments about point (b)

whence, Qadc = 157.3 lb./in. with sense as
assumed.


To find qcb take ZF z = 0


ZF z = 5000 + 200 - 157.3 x 11.5   - 11.5


qcb = 0


Whence, qcb = 295 lb./in.


To find qba take ZF x = 0


ZF x = -500 + 3000 + 500 - 157.3 x 15

whence, qba = 42.7 lb./in.


With these supporting skin forces on the
rib boundary, the rib is now in equilibrium
and thus the web shears and flange loads can
be determined. Consider as a free body that
portion of the rib just to the left of the
stiffener ad centerline as shown in Fig. A21.26.

To find flange load T take moments about

ZM a = (16/17)T x 9.3   - 157.3 x 60 x 2 = 0


whence, T = 2158 lb.


To find flange load C take ZF x = 0


ZF x = 2158 (16/17) - C = 0, whence C = 2034 lb.


To find web shear Qad take ZF z = 0


ZFz = 2158 (6/17) - 157.3 x 9.3 + 9.3 Qad = 0

whence, qad = 74.6.1b./in.


To find the shear in the web just to right
of stiffener ad, consider the free body formed
by cutting through the rib on each side of the
stiffener attachment line as shown in Fig.
A21.27. The forces as found above are shown
on this free body.



Fig. A21. 27

To find flange
load C' take ZF x = 0,
considering joint (a) as a free body,


ZF x = 2034 + 3000 - C' = 0, whence, C' = 5034 lb.

At joint (d) T' obviously equals 2158 lb. The
stiffener ad carries a compressive load of 5000
lb. at its (a) end and decreases uniformly by
the amount equal to the two shear flows or
463 + 74.6 = 537.6 lb./in.


The results obtained by considering Fig.
A21.27 could also be obtained by treating the
entire rib portion to the left of a section
just to right of stiffener ad, as shown in Fig.
A21.28.


To find rib flange load T' take moments
about point (a).

whence, C = 500 lb.


To find flange load T take ~Fx = 0


~F x = 3000 - 157.3 x 15 - 15 x 42.7   - 500 + T = 0


whence, T = 500 lb.


To find q;b take ~Fz = 0


~Fz = 5000 -157.3 x 11.5   - 11.5 q~b = 0


whence, qbb = 278 Ib./in.


The above results could have been obtained
with less numerical work by considering the
forces to right of section cb in Fig. A21.29.


A21. 6 Stress Analysis of Rib for Single Cell
Multiple stringer Wing.


When there are more than three spanwise
stringers in a wing, there are four or more
panels in the cell walls, thus the reactions of
the cell walls upon the rib boundary cannot be
found by statics as was possible in the 3
stringer case of the previous example problem.


Fig. A21.30 illustrates a wing section consisting of four spanwise flange members. The
concentrated loads acting at the four corners
of the box might be representative of reactions
from the engine mount or nacelle structure and
the reactions from a rib which supports the
wing flap. These loads must be distributed
into the walls of the wing box beam which necessitates a rib. Before the rib can be designed,
the bending and shear forces on the rib must be
determined. The calculations which follow
illustrate a method of procedure.

Fig. A21. 30

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-459-0.png)


SOLUTION:


The total shear load on the wing in the Z
direction equals V z = -6000 - 5000 + 2000 =
-9000 lb. and V x = -8500 + 7500 - 4000 + 4500 =
-500 lb.


The boundary forces on the rib will be
equal to the shear flow force system on the
cell walls due to the given external force
system.


From Chapter A14, page A14.8, equation (14)
the expression for shear flow is,


qy = -(K3VX-K~Vz) ~xA    - (K 2 V Z -K~Vx)


~zA      - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - (1)


The constants K depend on the section
properties of the wing cross-section. Table
A21.1 gives the calculation of the moment of
inertia and product of inertia about centroidal
Z and X axes. In this example the 4 stringers
a, b, c and d have been considered as the entire
effective material in resisting wing bending
stresses.

A21. 10 LOADS AND STRESSES ON RIBS AND FRAMES



With the wing section properties known,
the constants K can be calculated.


K 1 = 1xz/(1x1 z - 1xz 2 )

= -94.7/(225.8x1310-94.7 [2 ] ) =


-94.7/286700 = -.00033


K 2 = 1z/286700 = 1310/286700 = .00456


K 3 = 1x /286700 = 225.8/286700 = .000786


SUbstituting in equation (1),


qy =- G000786 (-500)    - (-.00033) (-90008

whence,


qy = 3.363 ZxA + 41.205 ZzA    - (2)


Since the shear flow at any point on the
cell walls is unknown, it will be assumed zero
on web ad, or imagine the web is cut as shown
in Fig. A21.31. The static shear flows can
now be found.


Gab = 3.363 (-ll.8) (2.0) + 41.205 x 6.36


x 2 = 444 lb./in.


qbc = 444 + 3.363 x 18.2 x 1.25 + 41.205


x 4.41 x 1.25 = 748 lb ./in.


qcd = 748 + 3.363 x 18.2 x 1.15 + 41.205

(-7.54)(1.15) = 461 lb./in.


These shear flows are plotted on Fig.
A21.31. Refer to Chapter A14 regarding sense
of shear flows.

The moments of the forces in the plane of
the rib will now be calculated:


Taking moments about the c.g. of the beam
cross section (See Fig. A21.31):



ZM c .g. = -llOOO x ll.8   - 8500 x 6.36   - 7500 x

2x90-748x2xl08.7-461x2x99 =-648400 in.lb.


F0r equilibrium ZM c •g • must equal zero,

therefore a constant flow shear ql acting around
the rib perimeter is necessary which will produce a moment of 648400 in. lb.


M 648400
ql = 2A = 2 x 368.5 = 880 lb./in.


(Note: 368.5 = total area of cell)


Adding this shear flow to that of Fig.
A21.31, the resulting force system of Fig.
A21.32 is obtained. The reactions of the beam

cell walls on the rib have now been determined
and the bending moments and shears on the rib
can now be calculated.

Moments at section B-B will be referred to
the point (0):


ZMO = -llOOO x 11. 8 - 8500 x 6.36 - 7500 x 5.64 + 436


x 2 x 36 + 880 x 2 x 70.8 + 419 x 2 x 38.3 =


-38200 in. lb.


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-461-full.png)

The resultant external shear force along
the section B-B equals the summation of the z
components of all the forces.


v = ZFz = -11000 + 12 x 880 - 436 x 0.36 + 419


x 0.96 = -195 lb.


The resultant load normal to the section
B-B equals the summation of the force components in the x direction.


H = ZF x = -8500 + 7500 + (436 - 419) 11.8

= -800 lb.


Fig. A21.34 shows these resultant forces
referred to point (0) of the cross-section. If
we assume that the rib flanges develoD the
entire resistance to normal stresses·, we can
find flange loads by simple statics.


To find upper flange load F u take moments
about lower flange point.


ZM = 12.6 Fu -38200-800x6.6 = 0


whence, Fu = 3443 lb. tension


To find FL use _ZF_ _x_ = 0


_ZF_ _x_ = 3443 - 800 - FL = 0, whence FL =


2643 lb. compression.


The shear flow on web equals V/12.6 =
195/12.6 = 15.5 Ib./in. This result neglects
effect of flanges not being normal to section
B-B, which inclination is negligible in this

case.


If the entire cross-section of rib is
effective in bending, then the web thickness
and flange sizes of the rib would be needed
to obtain the section momGnt of inertIa which
is necessary in the beam equation for bending
stresses. The forces at (0) would then be
referred to neutral axis of section before
bending and shear stresses on the rib section
could be calculated.


To obtain a complete picture of the web
and flange forces, several sections along the
rib span should be analyzed as illustrated for
section B-B.


**A21.** 7 Rib Loads Due to Discontinuities in Wing
Skin Covering.


As referred to before, ribs in addition to
transmitting external loads to wing cell
structure are also a means of re-distributing
the shear forces at a discontinuity, the most
common discontinuity being a cut-out in one or
more of the webs or walls of the wing beam
cross section. The usual procedure in finding



**A21.** **11**


the boundary forces on a rib located adjacent
to a cut-out is to find the applied shear flows
in the wing on two sections, one on each side
of the rib. Then the algebraic sum of these
two shear flows will give the rib boundary
forces. With the boundary forces known the rib
web and flange stresses can be found as previously illustrated. The procedure can best
be illustrated by example problems.


**A21.** 8 Example Problem. Wing with Cut-Out
Subjected to Torsion.


Fig. A21.35 shows a rectangular single
cell wing beam with four stringers or flanges
located at the four corners. The upper surface
skin is discontinued in the center bay (2).

80000 in. lb. at Station (70) and a couple force
at Station (50) as shown in Fig. A21.35. The
problem will be to determine the applied forces
on rib (A).


SOLUTION:


The applied shear flow on the cell walls
will be found for two cross-sections of the
wing, one on each side of rib (A).


In bay (1) the torsional moment M is 80000
in.lb. The applied shear flow on a crosssection of the wing in bay (1) thus equals,


M = 80000 = 100 Ib./in.
q    - [_] 2A 2 x 10 x 40


This shear flow system is shown on Fig.
A21.36 which is a free body of rib (A). In
bay (2), since the top skin is removed, the
torsional moment must be taken by the front and
rear vertical webs, since any shear flow in the
bottom skin could not be balanced.


The torsional moment in bay (2) is,

The total shear load on eaco vertical web
thus equals 120000/40 = 3000 lb., which gives
a shear flow q' = 3000/10 = 300 Ib./in. on each
web. This applied shear is shown on the free
body of rib (A) in Fig. A21.36. On the left
end of the rib a shear flow of 100 is acting

up and on the other side a shear flow of 300
is acting down, thus the rib web must take the
difference or 200 acting down. On the right end
of the rib the load on the rib web is 200 Ib./
in. up. The loads on the top and bottom
flanges of the rib is obviously 100 Ib./in.
Fig. A21.37 shows the loads applied to the rib
boundary when the torsion in bay (1) and the
external couple force is transferred to the
cross-section of bay (2).


ADDITIONAL EFFECTS DUE TO DIFFERENTIAL BENDING
OF BEAMS IN BAY (2).


The torsion in bay (1) and the external
couple force are thrown off as couple force on
the front and rear beams of middle bay (2),
with the total shear load on each beam being
3000 lb. as previously calculated. These beam
shear loads must be transmitted to bay (3) and
thus cause bending of the beams in bay (2).
Since each beam is attached to relative rigid
box structures at each end, namely bays (1)
and (3), the beams tend to bend with no rotation
of their ends. If we neglect the deflections
of these end box structures, we can assume that
the beams bend with no rotation of their ends
or each beam is fixed ended. Fig. A21.38a
illustrates the deflection of the front beam in
bay (2) under the assumption of no end rotation.
The beam elastic curve has a point of inflection
at the span midpoint. Figs. 38b, c show the
beams bending moment and shear diagrams.


The end moments are 11 = VL/2 = 3000 x 30/2
= 45000 in.lb. Assuming the beam flanges
develop the entire bending resistance the beam

flange loads at the beam ends are P = 45000/10
= 4500 **lb** **o** (See Figo **a).**


The deflection of the rear beam would be
the reverse of Fig. a, and thus all forces
would also be reversed.


Fig. A21.39 shows bay (1) of the wing as a
free body acted upon by the flange loads due to
bending of the beams in bay (2). These internal
flange forces from bay (2) must be held in
equilibrium by the internal stresses in the adjacent wing structure of bay (1).

According to the well known principle of
mechanics formulated by Saint Vennat, the
stresses resulting from such an internal force
system will be negligible at a distance from
the forces. This distance in case of a cut-out
is usually assumed as approximately equal to
the width of the cut-out, or in general to the
width of the adjacent wing bay. Thus in Fig.
A21.39 the flange loads of 4500 Ibs. each are
assumed to be dissipated at a uniform rate for
a distance of 20 inches. Thus the shear flow
created by each stringer load which equals the
change in axial load per inch in the stringer
in bay (1) equals 4500/20 = 225 lb.


Fig. A21.40 shows a segment 1 inch wide
cut from wing bay (1) with the 6P load in each

cross-section the front web is first assumed
cut, and thus the static shear flow qs = Z6P
from cut face where qs is zero. Fig. A2l.40
shows this static shear flow.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-463-0.png)


For eqUilibrium of the cross-section, the
moment of the forces in the plane of the crosssection must equal zero. TakinG moments about
lower left hand corner of the qs force system,


M = 225x40xlO = 90000 in.lb. For eqUilibrium a moment of -90000 is necessary - . Therefore a constant shear flow system q must be
added to develop a moment of -90000. Thus
q = M/2A = (-90000/2xlOx40) = -112.5 lb./in.
Adding this shear flow to that for qs in Fig.
A21.40 gives the final values in Fig. A21.41.
This shear flow system represents the stress

to the differential bending of the beams in
bay (2). This shear flow system must therefore
be resisted by rib (A) as it must terminate at
end of bay (1). Therefore the shear flows in
Fig. A21,41 are applied boundary loads to
rib (A) and these must be added to the rib
loads in Fig, A21.37 to give the final rib loads

The mi"dle bay (2) has no skin on the
botto:n surface, or in other words, the middle
bqy hos a channel cross-section, which fact
often hapnens in practical wing design as for
example a space or well for a retractable landing gear. The problem will be to find the
shear flow in bays (1) and (2) and the boundary
loads on rib (A) between bays (1) and (2).


Solution No.1


This method of solution will make use of
the shear center location for bay (2) in order
to obtain the true torsional moment on bay (2).
With this torsional moment known, the procedure
is similar to the previous example involving
wing torsion only.


We will first calculate the shear flow in
wing bay (1). Fig. A21,44 shows the crosssection.

This torsional moment must be resisted by
front and rear beams. Hence shear load on
each beam = 115240/30 = 3841" lb.


As in the previous example problem involving torsion, the beams in bay (2) will be
assumed to bend without rotation of their ends,
or in other words the bending moment at midpoint of bay is zero. The flange loads at
points a, b, c and d on bay (1) from the differ


uniformly in bay (1) over a distance of 30

these flange loads equals ~P = P/30, whence


~Pa = ~Pd = 4000/30 = 133.3 and ~Pb = ~Pc

= 6000/30 = 200 lb.


Fig. A21.53 shows an element of bay (1)

Solution No.2



suIts check the results in Fig. A21.48 obtained

in solution method (1).



![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-466-2.png)

This method of solution first finds the
shear flow in all bays assuming bottom skin is
not removed in center bay (2). This f",i ves a
shear flow in the bottom skin. However, the
skin in bay (2) is actually removed so a
corrective set of shear flows on bay (2) along
the boundary lines of the bottom skin must be
applied to eliminate the shear flows found in
the bottom skin. The problem then consists of
finding the influence of these corrective shear
flows upon the shear flows as found for bays
(1) and (2) when bottom skin in bay (2) was
not removed. .--- --- 192 **---** **........** **..-** **-**

_





The first step is to find the shear flows
in all bays ass~~ing bottom skin in bay (2) is
not removed. The calculations would be exactly
like those in solution (1) and the shear flow
in all bays would be those in Fig. A21.46. The
bottom skin in Fig. A21.46 has a shear flow of



Fig. A21.60 shows the corrective shear
flows of Fig. A21.58 applied to bay (2). On the
bottom skin the corrective shear flow is shown
on the boundary of the cut-out. These shear


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-467-full.png)

flows cause differential bending of the front
and rear beams in bay (2). If we make the
assumjJtion that the beam end suffer no rotation,
the bending moment is zero at midpoint of the
bay and thus the flan~e loads at points a, b,
c and d of bay (1) equal the al~ebraic su~ of
the shear flows on each side of a flange times
half the span of bay (2) or 12.5 inches. Thus
from Fig. A21.60,


Pa = (192 + 128)12.5 = 4000 lb. compression


Pb = [(288] [ +] [ 192)12.5] = [6000] [ lb.] [ tension]


Pc [=] [ (288] [ +] [ 192)12.z)] = [6000] [ compression]


Pd = [(128] [ +] [ 192)12.5] = 4000 [tension]


Referring to Fig. A21.52, we find that the
P valueS above are the same as the P values
obtained by solution (1). Thus the remainder
of solution (2) would be identical to that in
SoDItion (1), and therefore the calculations
will not be repeated here.


A21. 10 Fuselage Frames


Frames in a fuselage serve the same purpose as ribs in wing structures. Ribs are
usually of beam or truss construction and can
be stress analyzed fairly accurately by statics.
Fuselage frames however, are of the closed
ring type of structure and are therefore statically indeterminate relative to internal
stresses. Once the applied loads on a frame
are known the internal stresses can be found
by the application of the elastic theory as
covered in Chapters AS, A9, AIO and All. The
loads on fuselage frames due to discontinuities
in the fuselage structure, such as those due to
windows and doors, can be approximately determined by the procedures previously presented
for wing ribs.


The photographs on pa~e 32 of Chapter A15
show some of the fr&~e construction of the
Douglas DC-S airliner. Other Dictures of
fuselage construction are given in Chapter A20.
Photographs A21.4 and 5 illustrate typical
frame construction and arrangement.


A21. 11 Supporting Boundary Forces on
Fuselage Frames.


When external concentrated loads are
applied to a fuselage frame through a suitable
fitting or connection, the frame is held in
equilibrium by reacting fuselage skin forces
which are usually transferred to the frame
boundary by rivets which fasten fusela~e skin
to frame. Since the fuselage shell is usually
stress analyzed by the beam theory, it is
therefore consistent to determine the distribution of the supporting skin forces by the
same theory.

A21. 12 Calculation of Frame Boundary Supporting Forces.


Example Problem 1


Fig. A21.61 illustrates a cross-section of
a circular fusela~e. Two concentrated loads of
2000 lb. each are applied to the fuselage frame
at the points indicated. The problem is to
determine the reacting shear flow forces in the
fuselage skin which will balance the two externally applied loads. This fuselage section
might be considered as the aft portion of a
medium size fuselage and the loads are due to
air loads on the horizontal tail surfaces. To

make the numerical calculations short the
fuselage stringer arrangement has been assumed

sym~etrical.


Solution:


In this solution the fuselage skin resisting forces will be assumed to vary according to
the general beam theory. The general flexural
shear flow equation for bending about the Y
axis is,

A21. 18 LOADS AND STRESSES ON RIBS AND FRAMES



q =_V I [z] ~zA, where Vz = 4000 lb.
y


The moment of inertia Iy of the fuselage
cross-section is required. In this simplified
illustration, the area of each stringer plus its
effective skin will be taken as .15 sq.in. The
student should of course realize after studying
Chapters A19 and A20 that the true effective
area should be used on the compressive side and
that the skin on the tension side of the fuselage is entirely effective. These facts would
tend to make the effective cross-section unsymmetrical about the Yaxis. Since the only purpose of this illustrative solution is to show
how the frame loads are balanced, the section
being assumed as symmetrical which will greatly
decrease the amount of calculations required.



= -31.82-6.275x .30x13.5 = -57.22


= -57.22-6.275x .15xlO = -66.62


= -66.62-60275x.l.5x5 = -71032


Due to symmetry of effective cross-section,
the shear flow is symmetrical about the Y axis.


As a check on the above work, the summation of the z components of the shear flow on
each skin panel between the stringers should
equal the external load of 4000 lb.


~F z of skin shear flow equals the vertical
projected length of each panel times the shear
flow q on that panel, or


~Fz = [1.4x16.57+2.7x31.S2+3.5X57.22


+ 5x66.62+5x71.32] 4 = 4000 lb.
(check)


Fig. A21.62 shows the frame with its
balanced load system. The internal stresses
can now be found by the methods of Chapters
AS to All.

Due to symmetry of effective section and
external loading, the shear flow in the fuselage
skin on the z axis or between stringers 1 and 1

stringer (1) the shear flow in the skin resisting the external loads of 4000 lb. can be

Example Problem 2. Unsymmetrical Vertical Loading


In certain conditions in flying and landing unsymmetrical concentrated loads are applied
to 'the fuselage or hull structure. For example,
Fi s. A21.63 shows the same section and frame as
wa~ used in Problem 1. Due to an unsymmetrical
load on the horizontal tail, the reactions from
the tail on the fuselage are as illustrated in
the figure. The total load in the z direction
is still 4000 lb. but the loads are not symmetrical about the z axis. For analysis purposes, consider the loads as transferred to the

e.g. of the section as indicated in Fig. A21.64.
The moment of the two loads about the e.g. =
1500 x 11.5 - 2500 x 11.5 = -11500 in .lb. The
shear load Vz = 4000 produces the same shear
flow pattern as Fig. A21.62. To balance the
moment of -11500, a constant shear flow q J.
around the frame is necessary.

**CHAPTER** A22

**ANALYSIS OF SPECIAL** **WING** **PROBLEMS**


ALFRED F. SCHMITT



A22. 1 Introduction.


In a previous chapter (A19) analyses of
wing beams were carried out using the engineering theory of bending and rational modifications
thereof. As discussed there, wing configurations which depart radically from the usual
conception of a "beam" present the engineer
with the choice of making approximate and/or
empirical corrections to bea~ theory, or of
following a complete analytic treatment of the
structure.


This chapter illustrates the latter approach to several special problems associated
with aircraft wing structures, viz., 

Art. A22.2 - stresses around a panel cutout
Art. _A22.3_    - Shear lag problem
Art. A22.4 - cutout in a box beam
Art. A22.5 - swept wing box beam


Aside from presenting one analytic treatment
of these problems, a discussion is given of the
physical nature of each phenomenon. An understanding of the nature of the problem is of,
prime importance, Since no one analytic
technique can be all-powerful in the solution
of stress problems. The analyst must exercise
judgment and ingenuity in approaching each new
situation.


In this chapter all analyses are made
using the matrix formulation of the Method of
Dummy Unit Loads (Chapters A7, AS), a familiarity with which is assumed.


Such problems as those listed above are
too unWieldy to be studied here in great detail;
hence no attempt at exhaustive analyses has
been made. To bring into relief the main
features of each problem, the structure selected
for analySis is one which is simple in construction and so loaded as to exhibit clearly
the phenomenon under study. Many practical
detailS, such as the effects of sheet wrinkling,
rivet and fitting "give", stress concentrations,
etc., have been side-stepped so as not to becloud the objective. Further, the problems of
idealization of the original structure, into


 One other important special problem  - the so-called "bending stresses due to torsion" - is not treated here specifically.
As indicated in Chapter A8, the general box beam analysis
presented there encompasses this problem (Example Prob.
15, p. p. A8. 24 through A8. 27).



the one finally analyzed, are treated only
lightly; additional references are cited where
appropriate.


The analyses shown are strictly applicable
to (reasonably) thin-skinned wings only, wherein the "constant shear flOW" assumptions are
valid, viz.

i-the sheet carries shear stresses only
ii    - normal (direct) stresses are carried
in the flanges (spar caps and stringers) with
effective areas of skin lumped in. In all
cases handled here the skin was assumed fully
effective (stresses below skin buckling stress see Art. A19.ll, Chapter A19).


To enhance the usefulness of these problems,
all the structures chosen for analysis were
taken from referenced NACA (National Advisory
Committee for Aeronautics) publications wherein
the reader may find detailed discussions of the
problems, other methods of analysis and data
obtained from tests upon the specimens. Where
available, these data have been used herein for
comparison.


A22. 2 Stresses Around a Panel Cutout


"Cutouts in wings and fuselages constitute
one of the most troublesome problems confronting the aircraft designer. Because the stress
concentrations caused by cutouts are localized,
a number of valuable partial solutions of the
problem can be obtained by analyzing the behavior, under load, of simple skin-stringer
panelS" (1)**


ThUS, in the case of a wing beam With a
panel cutout of the upper surface (Fig. A22.1),
it would be feasible to analyze the section
immediately around the cutout as a flat sheetstringer panel under the action of axial
stringer loads and edge shears (coming from the
spar webs). The axial stringer forces could be
computed with sufficient accuracy by the engineering theory of bending (E.T.B.) since
these are removed sufficiently far from the
cutout proper. The edge shear flows are readily
computed by those elementary considerations
which give the spar-web shear flows.

end of the chapter.

Fig. A22. 2 Idealization of the half panel by
use of substitute stringers



The sheet-stringer panel may, in general,
contain a large number of longitudinal elements (stringers). The labor involved in
treating this multi-element structure in detail
is prohibitive, and thus an appropriate idealization must be made. First, it is likely that
the panel may be considered to be symmetric
about a longitudinal axis, so that only the
half-panel need be handled. Second, the complex, multi-stringer structure is replaced by
one having but three stringers. As indicated
in Fig. A22.2, these stringers are:


#1, a substitute stringer having for its
area all the effective area of the fully continuous members to one side of the "combing
stringer" (the stringer bordering the cutout)
and placed at the centroid of the area of
material for which it substitutes. The stress
which this stringer develops is then the
average stress for the material it replaces.


#2, the combing stringer, being simply the
main continuous stringer bordering the cutout.


#3, another substitute stringer, this
one replacing all of the effective material
made discontinuous by the cutout. It is located
at the centroid of the material it replaces,
and its stress is the average stress for this
same material. 

The sheet thicknesses used are the same
as those of the actual structure.**


- An alternate idealization, in which stringers #1 and #3 are
located along the lines AB and CD, respectively (Fig. A22.2),
was used in Reference (2) for a box beam loaded in torsion.


** When the longitudinal members themselves contribute to
the shear stiffness of the cover (as is the case for "hat" section
stringers riveted to the skin so as to form small closed
cross sections), an effective thickness must be used. This
point is discussed in Reference (3). In this source, however,
the increase in shear stiffness is accounted for, not by
increasing skin thickness, but by decreasing the panel width an equivalent procedure.



Fig. A22.3 gives the geometry of the idealized panel.

Fig. A22.4 is an exploded view of the halfpanel showing the placement and numbering of the
internal generalized forces (Art. A7.9, Chapter
A7) and the external loading. Note that the
applied axial stresses were assumed to be constant chordwise, giving stringer loads proportional to the stringer areas; their sum is
P 2, one of external loads.


The applied edge shear flows, coming from
the spar web, were assumed constant spanwise,
as from a constant shear load. Other load
distributions may be handled by allowing these
applied shears to vary from panel to panel.
For very extreme load variations additional
transverse members could be inserted to create
more spanwise panels allowing a better fit to
the spar shear variation. The applied shear
flows were considered as the other external
load and designated P 1 •


Panels on the centerline have zero shear
due to symmetry (Fig. A22.3).

Experience has shown that for symmetric
panels symmetrically loaded it is satisfactory
to consider transverse members to be rigid in
their own planes (4). Thus, in thiS problem,
member flexibilities for forces q6' qs' q7 and
q S may be taken to be zero. In the actual
NACA test specimen with which results are to
be compared, those transverse members bordering
the cutout appeared to have been heavily reinforced (to an extent unknown to the writer).
Hence it is logical to take their stiffnesses
as great.


Member flexibility coefficients were
collected in matrix form as below using the
formulas of Chapter A7. Note that the coefficients for sUbscripts 5, 6, 7 and 8 were
set equal to zero (rigid transverse members).



A22.3


The half panel was twice indeterminate.
Member loads q sand qa were selected as redundants. With these set equal to zero, successive
applications of loads PJ. and P 2 were made.
Also, successive applications of unit values of
qs and qe were made. The results:

The "off diagonal" values have negative sign because the sense of those internal generalized forces having subscripts (14), (15),
(17) and (18) was taken opposite to that used in the derivation in Art. A7.10. A change in sense requires a change in sign in
off -diagonal coefficients only.

Comparison of this result with the previous one for the rigid ribs reveals that the
most important effect of rib flexibility was
to increase the concentration of stresses in
the combing stringer bordering the cutout. It
should be noted, however, that for this symmetric panel, the use of a very flexible rib
as compared with a rigid rib led to stress increases of the order of only 10% in the combing
stringer. Thus, the "rule of thumb" that transverse flexibilities may be neglected in summetric panels is re-affirmed.


A22.3 Shear Lag Analysis of Box Beams


"The bending stresses in box beams do not
always conform very closely to the predictions
of the engineering theory of bending. The
deviations from the theory are caused chiefly
by the shear deformations in the cover of the
box that constitutes the flange of the beam.
The problem of analyzing these deviations from
the engineering theory of bending has become
known as the shear lag problem, a term that is
convenient though not very descriptive." (3)


Fig. A22.6 illustrates the basic problem.
The beam cover sheet is loaded along the edges
by shear flows from the spar webs. These shear
flows are resisted by axial forces developed
in the longitudinal members (spar caps and
stringers). According to elementary considerations, the stringer stresses should be uniform
chordwise at any given beam station ("elementary theory" in the figure). Actually, the
central stringers tend to "lag behind" the
others in picking up the load because the

shear. The action may be comprehended readily
by visualizing an extreme case: a large degree
of "lag" would occur if the load transferring
skin were made of a highly flexible material
such as a plastic sheet or even rubber. In such
a case the inside stringers would be out of
action almost entirely! With the inside stringer
stresses lagging, the outside stringers and spar
caps must carry an over-stress to maintain
equlli bri um ("actual" in the figure).

The beam is an idealization of one tested
by the NACA and reported in reference (3). Note
that the beam has no lower cover sheet a~d that
it is symmetric about a vertical axis. Transverse bulkheads are located at stations 12", 24",
36" and 48" from the root.


The actual beam specimen had three more
stringers than shown in the idealized structure,
these being located one each midway between the
pairs of longitudinals shown on the beam cover
of Fig. A22.7. In the idealizing process, these
extra stringer areas were divided equally between adjacent longitudinals. The stringer
areas shown are the effective areas, with those
in the top cover tapering linearly from root to
tip. All skin was considered effective in
carrying direct stresses.


Some detailed discussions of the techniques
of idealization of practical beams are given in

because of symmetry, it was necessary to treat
only one-half of the structure. In addition,
no shear flows could appear in the middle
panels. Further, it is known that the influence
of rib flexibility on shear lag is slight for
symmetric systems, so that the ribs were considered rigid in their own planes; hence no
generalized forces were needed on the ribs to
describe their strain energies.

A22.8 ANALYSIS OF SPECIAL WING PROBLEMS



A22. 4 Stress Analysis of a Box Beam With a Cutout.


In Article A22.2, one technique was employed for computing the stresses around a cutout. In that analysis the effect of the cutout
was presumed to have been localized about the
cutout region; consequently, the problem was
treated by isolating the affected panel. Quite
often, when the cutout is placed well inboard
on the wing, its influence on the root stresses
is appreciable. Therefore, it is desirable to
be able to consider the overall problem of the
box beam with a cutout for such cases.


"The most convenient and the most rapid
method of analyzing structures with cutouts is
the indirect, or inverse, method. The analysis
by the indirect method is made in two steps.
First, the structure is analyzed for the basic
condition that exists before the cutout is
made. The results of this basic analysis are
used to calculate the internal forces that
exist along the boundary of the proposed cutout.
External forces equal and opposite to these
internal forces are then introduced; these
external forces reduce the stresses to zero
along the boundary of the proposed cutout, and
consequently the cutout can now be made without
disturbing the stresses." (3)*


It is desired to modify the calculation of
the previous article (A22.3, "Shear Lag
AnalYSiS") to allow for the presence of two
cutouts symmetrically placed. Panel "q :1.2" was
removed while the single tip load remained.
Since the unit remained symmetric, the data
from the previous analysis, in which the transverse rib stiffnesses were taken to be
infinitely great, shOUld still yield satisfactory results.


SOLUTION:


The calculation was accomplished in three
steps:


1) The stress distribution was found in
the "basic structure" (no cutout). This work
was carried out in Article A22.3 where it was
found that q:J.2 = .02401 Ibs ./inch.


2) A stress distribution was found for
an "applied load" of q]'2 = l. Such a loading
has zero external resultant.


3) .02401 times this last stress distribution was subtracted from the first.


 - The procedure described here is quite generally useful for
studies of the effect of removing one or more members;
such might be required for an analysis of the effects of
structural damage.



The calculation for step (2) above, will
now be carried out by considering a unit shear
flow, q:l.2 = 1, applied while all other loads
are zero. Under this loading condition the
relative displacements at redundant cuts 2, 7
and respectively, 17 are equal where to these OC 2, :1.2' coefflcients e-e 7 1 :1.2 and =:1.7 have ' :1.2
been computed previously in Article A22.3.


To restore continuity (reduce the relative
displacements to zero) three redundant forces
are applied, one each, at the cuts 2, 7 and 17.
The appropriate equations specifying continuity

are

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-478-0.png)


Note that these equations say simply that
the deflections at the redundant cuts due to
the (unknown) redundant forces must be equal
and opposite to the deflections due to q:l.2 = 1.


All coefficients in the above equation
were computed in Art. A22.3. Specifically,

The above matriX is the [ocrsJ of Art.

COMPARISON WITH TEST DATA:


Reference 3 reports test data for the case
analyzed, the stringer stresses being plotted
below in Fig. A22.11.


In the actual test specimen a stringer
passing through the cutout was severed, it having zero stress at stations 12 and 24, therefore. However, during the idealization process
discussed in Art. _A22.3_ (for the beam without
cutout) the area for this stringer was placed
partly with the combing stringer and partly
With the spar cap. In the same way, some
effective sheet from the midportion of the
panel, now made discontinuous by the cutout,
was added also to the spar cap and combing
stringer.


It follows then that the fUll idealized
areas of the combing stringer and spar cap
ShOUld not be used in figuring the stresses at
stations 12 and 24 (produced by forces qg'
ql0' Q14' q16)' With these areas reduced by
the appropriate sUbtractions, the stresses
were computed and are plotted in Fig. A22.11.
Agreement With test data is seen to be quite
satisfactory.

A22.5 Analysis of a Swept Box Beam.


"Experimental investigations of swept box
beams have shown that the stresses and distortions in a swept wing can be appreciably different in character from those that would exist if
the root were normal to the wing axis. The
principle effect of sweepback on the stresses
occurs under bending loads and consists in a
concentration of bending stress and vertical

shear in the rear spar near the fuselage. With
regard to distortions, the effect of sweep is
to produce some twist under loads that would
produce only bending of an unswept wing and
some bending under loads that would produce
only twist of an unswept wing." (6)


In the following example a swept box beam
is analyzed by the matrix methods of Chapter A8
and, in particular, by the specific techniques
of reference (7). The method accounts for the
interaction between the swept cover panels and
the longitudinal members. It is this action
that is responsible for the distinctive
structural characteristics of the swept box
beam.


Again, we emphasize that the method used
here is strictly applicable to thin-skinned
wings of beam-like proportions only. Considering the wide variety of structural layouts
which may be employed in swept wing configurations, a comprehensive treatment cannot be given
here. An excellent review of methods better
adapted to thick-skinned construction and to
"plate-like" (very thin, wide) wings, may be

found in reference (8). One method of analyzing such wings is given in Chapter A23.


THE STRUCTURE:


The structure shown is Fig. A22.l2 is an
idealization of the NACA test beam of references (6) and (9), in which a single substitute
stringer has been employed along the cover
sheet to allow for the antitipated shear lag
effect. The figure shows only one-half of the
complete unit, which was built symmetrically
about the axis corresponding to the longitudinal
axis of the airplane.


Only tip loads were to be applied (at
points A and B). The outer section of the beam
was assumed to carry stresses which could be
calculated reasonably well by the engineering
theory of bending (E.T.B.). For this purpose
it was judged satisfactory to consider the
outer 66" of the beam as a single bay (A-B-D-C).
If loads were to have been applied inboard of
the tip, it would have been necessary to consider additional bay divisions between A-B and
C-D (that is, insert additional ribs at stations

test specimen and was
plane.



Rib C-D was located at
locations in the NACA
assumed rigid in its own



The choice of bay C-D-F-E as a single bay
was somewhat arbitrary. For improved accuracy,
additional ribs inboard of C-D could have been
used. Note that any ribs placed inboard of
point F will produce triangular skin panels in
the cover sheets. Examples of treatments for
such panels may be found in references (9),
(10) and (ll).


Rib E-F was considered flexible in its own
plane, it being known that the flexibility of a
rib is important at a location where a structure
changes direction.* Note that this rib was
made of steel in the test specimen.


Effective areas of longitudinals as shown
in Fig. A22.12 were computed by considering all
of the skin to be effective. The spar cap
areas are equal to the sum of the areas of the
angle member at the cap location, plus onehalf of the effective area of material between
the cap and the sUbstitute stringer (this area
inclUdes several stringers as well as skin)
plus one-sixth of the attached spar web area:*
The substitute stringer area was collected in
like manner from the half-panels to either side.


The method used in calculating the
effective areas of the rib caps (E-F) is given
in detail in reference (9), from which the
value used here was taken. The "carry-through
bay" cover sheet thickness is equal to that
used on the specimen (.050") plus a weighted
increase to allow for the presence of splice
plates along the plane of symmetry (see reference 9).


INTERNAL GENERALIZED FORCES:


Fig. A22.13 shows the choice and numbering
of the generalized forces.


The beam was rigidly supported at pOints
E, F and at the two corresponding points on the
other beam half. These might correspond to the
fuselage ring attach points in an airplane.
The vertical end caps on rib E-F were considered
rigid axially, so that no flexibility coefficients were associated with the reactions



A22.11


affects total deflections only and can be
omitted in a stress analyses where deflections
are not sought.


Since only symmetric loadings were considered in this analysis no shear was transmitted by the carry-through bay and hence no
shear flows were shown in that portion.


Sets of additional axial forces (q~6
through q~e) were applied to the ends of the
flanges and stringers adjacent to the obliquely
cut ends of the cover sheet panels in bay
C-D-F-E. These forces are necessary to account
for the interaction between the swept covers
and the longitudinals. As shown in Fig. A22.14,
the pure shear flow on the oblique edge is obtained by superposing onto the panel a zeroresultant system consisting of a uniform tensile
stress of intensity 2q plus a pair of concentrated balancing loads. The balancing loads
must be contributed by the bordering longitudinals and hence react on these as tensile loads
(Fig. A22.14c). The balancing loads applied to
the stringers are shown dashed since they are
internal forces within the bay and are not to
be entered into the equilibrium equations for
the structure.

From an energy viewpoint, these dashed
forces account for the additional strain energy
stored by the axial components of shear flows
in the non-rectangular panels. This energy is
stored in the cover panels themselves (and is
accounted for in this manner since the longitudinals contain the effective area from the
cover sheet***) and in the longitudinals which
react against these components.

 - The effect of neglecting this rib's flexibility is demonstrated later in this example.



** The factor of 1/6 is used so that the effective area contribution of the web results in a structure haVing the same
moment of inertia about a horizontal axis as the original.
Some of the problems of idealization are discussed in
reference (2), p. 16.



*** This much of the energy could be accounted for in another
fashion by modifying the member flexibility coefficient for
the sheet panel. See Reference 12, where this was done.
However, that referenc e incorrectly neglects the additional
energy stored in the longitudinals, as was demonstrated in
Reference 13.

if they too were cut obliquely. Such panel
configurations arise often in swept wing construction having ribs parallel to the airstream. Formulae for more general quadrilateral
panels are given in Reference 7.


THE STRESS DISTRIBUTIONS


For the symmetric loadings considered
here the structure was indeterminate only two
times since the outer bay was assumed to be
determinate by the E.T.B.


Stresses in outer bay by E.T.B.:

For a unit transverse load at the shear
center (midpoint, because of symmetry)



Stresses in inner bays:


According to the discussion of Art. A8.12,
Chapter A8, the determinate stress distribution

~i~' may be any stress distribution in eqUil
ibrium with the applied loads, and preferably
one close to the final true stress distribution
The magnitude of the redundant forces is re
duced by use of a satisfactory estimate of the
true stresses.


The stresses in the two inner bays were
determined for both gim and gir simUltaneously.
Since this inner portion of the structure is
two times indeterminate we can estimate two
loads. For this purpose the two flange loads
q ~" and q1.4 were written as


qu = q~" + q~"

q1.4 = q~4 + q~4


where the (single) primed values are approximate values determined by the E.T.B. and the
double primed values are the unknown corrections
(the redundants). Using My/I at stations 66"
and 118" from the tip gave*


q~" = 5.228 P~ + 5.228 P"


q~4 = 3.899 P~ + 3.899 p ..


The equilibrium equations for the elements
of the structure were written next by summing
forces and moments.


Joint F


q"3 + q"6 = [0]

q"3 -+ q"6 = [1.414] qu
= [5.513] P~ + 5.513 P" + 1.414 q~ 4


Joint E


q .. 4 + q"o = [0]

q"4    - q"o = [1.414] q~"
= 7.392 P1. + 7.392 P" -+ 1.414 q~ "

m about E-F


q"4 + q"6 + q"6 = [11.918] [ P1.] -+ 8.888 P"


 This is a rather crude way to estimate these loads and is
used here only for simplicity. The analyst is generally better
advised to exercise a little more ingenuity in making these
estimates, even to the extent of being guided by other swept
wing solutions.

The unit load was shifted 15" to either side
by application of a torque, T = 15 in.lbs.
The uniform shear flow superposed was

Finally, superposition gave the stresses

The first five of the above equations

Also, from equilibrium of joint G:


The remaining seven equations were
arranged for solution thus:

After inverting the matrix of coefficients

and mUltiplying through thereby, the stresses
were obtained as

Fig. A22.15 Comparison Between Calculated and
Measured Stresses (psi) in a Swept
Box Beam.


Fig. A22.15 shows a comparison between
the calculated stringer stresses and those
measured by the NACA as reported in Reference 6.
The stresses shown are for a unit tip load,
centrally placed (p~ ~ p .. ~ 1/2 lb.).



requirement. More details concerning the testing techniques and method of data presentation
would probably resolve this conflict. Both test
and calculated values clearly exhibit the
characteristic build-up of stresses in the rear
spar of a swept wing.


RIB E-G-F RIGID:


As a matter of interest, it was decided to
investigate the effect upon stresses when rib
E-G-F is taken to be rigid. Such a calculation
is readily achieved by putting the member
flexibility coefficients for the rib equal to

zero.


Thus, in the matrix ~ ij], those coefficients with subscripts 19, 20, 21, 22 and
23 were set equal to zero and the complete
calculation was repeated.


The results, for spar cap loads at the wing
root (a most sensitive point), were:







:::
Considering the limitations on the analysis
the agreement is generally satisfactory. Thus,
the discrepancy in the My/I stresses at station
65 may be attributed to a lack of precise A comparison
knowledge of the test parameters. The calcu- lations follows:
lated stresses in the leading edge spar between
stations 65 and 118 cannot duplicate the experimental variation since only a single bay
was employed in this region in the idealization. Simple
The fact that the calculated root stresses run Bending; q1 ..
consistently above the test values is difficult P1 =P .. =1 q14
to explain. Inasmuch as the calculated stresses
satisfy equilibrium, the test values, all being Torsion; q12
lower, would seem to defy this fundamental P~=-P .. ~l 14

_A23._ 1 Introduction


The displacement or stiffness method (1-4)*
is a structural analysis procedure using displacements as the independent variables (and
unknown quantities) rather than the forces. As
applied here, the displacement method will be
used in conjunction with a structural modeling
using finite elements. Typical elements used
are rod and beam segments, thin sheet and plate
sections, and conical shell frusta. The number
of unknown displacements is determined by the
number of elements chosen and the lcwel of
sophistication or detail used in modeling. It
is assumed that the description given by displacements of selected nodal points is adequate
to represent the deformation of the structure.
If a better representation is needed, the
structure may be modeled by more nodes and
hence more elements. The actual loading is replaced by a set of nodal forces calculated
using the method of virtual work.


The displacement methoQ has the following
advantages:


1. The coordinate transformation matriX is
easy to visualize and easy to generate, being
determined solely by the geometry of the system,


2. There is no difficulty in deciding how
to choose redundant reactions to yield a wellconditioned problem,


3. Matrices tend to be banded ones when
using the displacement method, resulting in
economies during computer storage and matrix
manipulations,


4. The treatment of structural dynamics
and structural stability are simplified because
the inertial and geometric properties of elements and systems transform from coordinate
system to coordinate system using the same
matrices as are used in transforming the element and system stiffness properties,


5. The number of unknowns is based on the
number of coordinates chosen, While in the
force method redundant forces are the unknowns.
Thus the displacement method is favored for
analyzing highly-redundant structures such as
frames.

Numbers **in** parentheses designate References at end of
Chapter.



Of course both metrlOds can be used to describe structural behavior. For example, some
of the disadvantages of the force method can be
overcome by means of progranulled automatic redundant selectors or "structure cutters." The
engineer must be fa'niliar wIth both methods in
order to perform the analysis function efficiently.


The formulation of the displacement method
has been perfected within the last 15 years,
prompted by the availability of large electronic
digital computers. In 1950, the solution of a
system involVing ten or twelve independent coordinates represented a massive effort for an
analyst working by hand With a desk calculator.
Present computer programs routinely handle
structures represented by thousands of coordinates. structural analysis can now be used in
the design process for preliminary or parametric calculations because of this increase in
capability and speed. With on-line graphics
equipment, the design engineer can even manipulate his design by supplying and receiving
information directly during computer calculations.


We note here, as an aside, that the Moment
Distribution Method of Chapter All, the Slope
Deflection Method of Chapter A12 and the Method

of Successive Corrections of Chapters A6 and A15
are all examples of the Displacement Method of
structural analysis. In each of these methods
the displacements are taken as the independent
variables, and these are adjusted to achieve
eqUilibrium of the loaded structure. The adjustment may appear as a systematic relaxation
of artificial constraints (Moment Distribution
and Successive Corrections) or it may be done
mathematically in one stroke by the solution
of a set of simultaneous equations (Slope Deflection Method). The latter approach-solution
of a set of simultaneous equations-is essentially that followed herein, the solution usually
being effected by matrix inversion or Gaussian
el1minat i on.


A23.2 Structural Coordinates


It would be impossible to consider the deSlections of each particle of a structure. Instead, we characterize the system by a finite
number of quantities which describe in a gross
way (but a sufficiently useful way) the deformed
shape of the system. These quantities are called



A23. 1


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-488-full.png)

A23.2 ANALYSIS BY THE METHOD OF DISPLACEMENTS



coordinates, and are of two kinds, discrete and
distributedo Both kinds involve a simplified
modeling of reality.


Discrete coordinates are used if the
principal modes of deformation can be identified
in terms of displacements of a finite number of
points.


For example, with a beam element, we assume that the deformed shape can be adequately
described in terms of the motion of the ends of
the element. For each end there are six components of motion, three for linear displacement and three for rotation (Fig. A23.1). The
deformation of the element therefore is described only to the degree possible by defining
the deflection and rotation of ends 0 This
description is obviously completely adequate if
no external loads are applied along the element.
If loads are applied along the element and
greater detail is desired, nodal points can be
defined at interior locations, effectively
breaking each member into two or more elements.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-488-0.png)


Fig. A23.1


Distributed coordinates are space functions
which simultaneously approximate the displacements of all points of an elastic member. For
example, if we have a simply supported beam, we
might describe it using the ~ functions shown in
Fig. A23.2.

**...** **-** **...** **-** **--** **....** **_** **....** ..... --~"


'~ x L



Here again, an exact representation cannot be
given because, for practical reasons, the series
used is of finite extent 0


When a collection of elements are joined
into a system, there are certain connectivity or
constraint conditions and boundary conditions
which characterize the system, and which distin
gUish it from a mere pile of elements.


To fix these concepts, we consider the example of a simple portal frame whose deformation
is assumed to be restricted to the plane of the
figure (Fig. A23.3).

The constraints and boundary conditions are


1. Fixed end conditions (no deflection) at
points A and D.


2. Kinematic constraints at points Band
C, such that deflections and rotations of elements 1 and 2 are the same at point B, and of
elements 2 and 3 are the same at point C.


After eliminating" duplicate coordinates, we
are left with six system coordinates as shown
in Fig. A23.4. Element coordinates are denoted
by ° and structural system coordinates by u,
respectively. (The symbols used generally follow those of Rubinstein, Refs. 1 and 2. Thus
the reader interested in stUdying the theory
in greater detail will not need to learn a new
glossary) .

Thus As a practical matter, the kinematic constraints are taken into account when compiling
the system stiffness matrix. The boundary conditions may be treated in the same way or, if


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-489-full.png)

desired, may be applied all at once in a subsequent step. A further simplification is common
in many structural problems. The stresses and
strains due to axial loads within an element
are often much smaller than those produced by
bending loads. For such cases one may assume
that the frame members are inextensible. Thus,
in Fig. A23.4, we may take u~ = u~ = 0, and u~ =
ui, and are left with three generalized coordinates for this level of modeling abstraction.
Fig. A23.5 shows the structural deformation patterns corresponding to these generalized coordinates.

Various methods have been used; we will illustrate the procedure by employing the theorem of
virtual work in the case of an elastic rod, and
the differential equation of flexure in the
case of a beam. The forces and displacements
of elements will be denoted by P and 0, respectively, as distinguished from forces and
displacements at nodal points of a structural
system, denoted by F and u, respectively.

A23.3 Theoretical Basis of the Method of Displacements The total axial strain is uniform, and given by



To perform a static analysis of a given
structure, we must derive relationships between
external, applied forces JFI and the nodal
points' generalized deflections luI. In particUlar, since the deflections are to be treated
as independent quantities, we seek to derive an
equation


lF~ = [KJ lu~    - - - - - - - - - - - - - (2)


wher~ the matriX [KJ is the system stiffness
matrix. (Throughout this chapter, matrix notation has been employed. The symbols used are
defined in Appendix A, except where noted).


To give the elements of the stiffness
matrix physical meaning, we may consider an experiment in which one of the u's, say us, is
given a unit deflection. The elements of the
sth column of [KJ are equal to the forces necessary to give the structure this deflected configuration, or equally, the elements of the sth
column are the forces developed at each of the
nodal points when coordinate s is deflected a
unit amount with all other coordinates held
fixed. Within this sth column, the element K rs
is the force developed at coordinate r in that
deformed configuration. The system stiffness
matrix is compiled by adding together the individual element stiffness matrices, as will be
demonstrated later.


Stiffness properties of structural elements
are defined by applying the theory of elasticity
to the particular configuration of interest.

ex = L (0 2 - o~)



(4)



If the rod is SUbjected to an increase in temperature of T degrees as well as an axial stress
(load), the total strain ex is equal to the
elastic strain EX, plus the thermal strain~T.
The elastic strain is the quantity needed to
calculate the strain energy, that is,


                                   -                                    -                                    (5)


Rewriting Eq. 2, page A7.1, in terms of strain,
using the substitutions GxA = Sand ExE = Gx
for the elastic rOd, we find

V = A~L E~ = ~~ [( O 2   - O~)   - O(TL r--- (6)


Using the theorem of virtual work (Eq. 14, page

and we recognize the square matrix as [k], the
element stiffness matrix for axial deflection
of an elastic rod. The elements of [kJ may
also be calculated directly by rewriting the

This result is of interest also because it

demonstrates the s~netry of the stiffness

As a second illustration, we will use the
solution of the differential equation of flexure to derive the stiffness matrix of a beam.
Consider a unit end deflection, 03 = 1, in Fig.

is only one independent coordinate here, which
is represented physically by the change in angle
at one of the corners due to the shearing action
of the applied forces.


G. Other Elements


Only the simplest elements have been shown
in this section. Fortunately, many practical
problems can be worked using this information,
since a comprehensive catalog of elements could
easily fill a separate chapter. Other elements
having widespread application are two-dimensional elements with membrane forces (including
triangular, square, and trapezoidal elements),
two-dimensional plate bending elements (including triangular, square and trapezoidal elements),
thin shell elements (including conical frusta
and doubly curved elements), axisymmetric thick
shell elements (including ring elements having
various cross-section configurations), and
general three-dimensional elements (including
tetrahedron and hexahedron elements). These
and other elements are being developed and perfected by structural analysts. It is worth
noting that lack of interelement compatibility
is an imDortant s!1ortcoming with the more complex finite elements, and provides the motivation for much continuing work. For details,
the reader is referred to the abundant literature in this field.


A23.5 Transformation of Coordinates


We will often need to transform displacements between original coordinates (or coordinates in which it was convenient to define
element properties) and generalized or independent coordinates. For this purpose, we use
geometry to define a transformation matrix G?J
given by


                                    -                                     (17)


For the portal frame of Figs. A23.3 and A23.5,
by inspection, we have



For convenience, the system _[e]_ matrix may be
partitioned into element [?~ matrices, as
shown. These smaller matrices may be used
one at a time to transform element properties,
as will be shown subsequently.


Similarly, we will want to transform
forces from system to system. Tne method for
doing this is derived from the expression for
Virtual work.


Consider forces F, associated with the u
coordinate system. For a set of virtual displacements (6 U}, the virtual work is*


6\-1 = (F} T 16U}      -      -      -      -      -      -      -      -      -      -      - (19)

For the ° system,


We also have the compatibility relationship


derived from the coordinate transformation.
Now, since virtual work is a scalar, and since
the pIS and F's are in equilibriwn, and the
o's and u's are compatible, the Virtual work is
the same in either system.


Thus


 - \ ) T and [ JT denote transpose of column and rectangular
matrices respectively.

and since the ~u' 3 are independent


which is the desired relationship.


We next ask how the stiffness and flexibility matrices are transformed from one set of
coordinates to another. The appropriate formula can be derived from the expression for the
strain energy in an element.



A23.7


so t F*l = [K u ] {U*} + [K a ] t [uo] 1 - -(32a)


and r O) = [Ke~] {u*J + [K ee ] t [uo] } -(32b)


or ~u01 = [-] [ [K] ee []] [ -~] [ [Ke~]] [u*1 - - (33)


SUbstituting back into Eq. 32a,


Therefore we may define a reduced stiffness
matrix



with to} = [fJ lUI' so the first expression may
be rewritten and, once the lU*} are known in any given problem, the {u [o] } may be found immediately from
Eq. 33.



and, since the u's are independent,


                                       (26)


For transforming the flexibility matrices (denoted by _[a]_ and [a] for element and system,
respectively) a further result is needed. From
equilibrium, we can find a relationship between
element forces {PI and external nodal point
forces t F 1

I P} = [bJ {Fl-   - - - - - - - - - - - - (27)


which defines [bJ (for an indetenninant structure, see below). Writing the strain energy of
an element


we can then substitute for }p} using Eq. 27 and
derive the final expression


[a] = [bJT _[a]_ [b]   - - - - - - - - - - (29)


where we have used the fact that the ~Fl forces
are independent.



Similarly, the flexibility method is useful in statically indeterminate structures
where the opposite situation pertains - that
is, where forces are associated with (redundant) zero displacements.


We extend fF} to include a set of selfequilibrating forces corresponding to the
number of redundants in the structure. For the
portal frame, there are three redundants, as
shown in Fig. A23.9. The disDlacements at the
redundants are actually zero.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-493-0.png)


Fig. A23.9


Thus we have



and by analogy with the ca8e of zero forces



Often there will be displacements in ~u1
which are associated with zero applied forces
in those· coordinates. Let

a;:Jpl1ed forces.

Then _U::_ r 0 } = r!-.L~ LK e ~ ! I Kee ~h!l.J f.-u-~-1- u - - - - - - - (31)



The flexibility method is useful also in
deriving a relationship between system forces

Given that F,- = 0 and Fa =-lOOOlb., we find
that the horizontal deflection U1 = 22500/E
inches and the vertical deflection Ua == -312900/E
inches. The final step is to compute element
forces. To do this, the element deflections
must be found using the transformation matrix

_[B]_ or [ee]. For member DC, using Eq. 43,

{:} [0.:55 (52)



0.500]{2~00 J = {-13~000}



(52)



We wish to systematize the solution by first
triangularizing the left-hand side of the
equations, resulting in fewer unknowns in each
successive equation, and culminating in a final
equation in the single unknown xn. The solution is completed by solving first for the last
unknown, xn, then using this information to
solve for xn_ 1, and so on. In the triangularized form, each unknown, xr say, depends
only on the xm' With n ~ m> r.


The first step in the triangularization
consists of calculating new coefficients for
the second equation and all subsequent equations using


i=2,, n
j = 2,, n+l                       - - (55)


which brings the equations to the form

The final form is

Thus the force in member OC is 274 lb. tension
which checks With the result found previously
in section 8.4. Similarly, the forces in members OA and OB are 335 lb. and 626 lb. respectively.


A23.7 Method of Gaussian Elimination


For large systems, involving solution for
tens, hundreds, or, often, thousands of unknowns, the matrix inversion method is more
time-consuming than other techniques. Basically, the alternate solution methods are divided
into two categories, elimination methods, and
iteration methods (5,6).


The method of Gaussian elimination or variants such as Cholesky decomposition are widely
used as practical solution methods -for large
systems of equations. The basic Gaussian elimination will be described and used here. Consider a system of linear equations,

A second class of solution methods involves
the use of iteration. Iterative methods of solution are particularly appealing for structures
whose description results in sparse matrices,
that is, matrices containing relatively few
nonzero elements. Large space frames and twoand three-dimensional solid bodies modeled with
finite elements are examples of such structures.
One widely used iteration technique is the
Gauss-Seidel method. In this method, an initial solution vector is generated, often by
guessing plausible values. This trial solution
is then systematically improved, by solving the
linear equations in sequence, using the current
values for all unknowns other than the one
being evaluated. As soon as an unknown has
been determined, it is incorporated in the
values used for subsequent steps within a
given iteration cycle, rather than waiting until
the cycle has been completed. As an illustration, consider the portal frame of Example
Problem 2, with an applied force F:I. = 24000 lb.
Asswne values of EI ~ lOa lb. in. [2] and L = 100
inches, and calculate the deflections using
Gauss-Seidel iteration. After making the
indicated SUbstitutions, and dividing through
by the common factor of 8000, the problem may
be brought to the form

For the iteration, a further reduction is
worthwhile, wherein only one unknown appears
on the left-hand side of each scalar equation.
FollOWing this manipulation, the equations to
be solved are


-(68a)



u 2 = -0.0075u:l. - 0.25u"


u" = 0.0075u:l. - 0.25u 2

As a trial solution, we take U:l. = 1, u 2 = U" =
0, inasmuch as we expect sidesway to be the
dominant deflection. The results at selected
steps of the procedure are given in Table
A23.4. The convergence does not appear to be
rapid, but methods exist for accelerating the
solution. For further details, the reader is
referred to a text on numerical analysis.

A23.9 Calculation of Nodal Forces for Loads Acting
Between Nodal Points


In many practical situations, the structure
is loaded at locations other than the nodal
points. Of course, in the case of concentrated
loads, this complication may be resolved by introducing nodes at the loading sites. However,
for distributed loads, such as pressure, there
is no way of avoiding the problem. Therefore,
we wish to derive a method for calculating
equivalent nodal forces which are consistent
with the finite element formulation of the problem. To do this, we employ the method of virtual work. As an example, consider the case of
an elastic beam element. Associated with each
nodal coordinate, there is a deflected shape or
distributed coordinate for the entire finite
element, found from the solution of the differential equation of beam bending. These shapes
are shown in Fig. A23.16.


ThUS, from Eq. 1, the connection between
nodal coordinates and the deformed shape of the
element is


Let the applied load be given by f(x) as shown
in Fig. A23.16e. Tnen the total virtual work
produced by the applied load acting through a
virtual displacement ~w is


_tM_ = _j_ L f (X) ~w (X) dx    - - - - - - - - (70)

and since the Llui are independent, the righthand sides of Eqs. 71 and 72 may be equated
term by term, giving the desired equation,


Pi = jL f(X)~i (X)dx, i = 1, ..., 4 - (73)

o

In the case of moments acting between nodal
points, a parallel development gives the result


Pi = jLm(X)~i (X)dx, i = 1, ..., 4 - ('74)

o

where m(X) is the applied moment and ¢i =
d¢/dx.


Several loading cases occur often enough
to justify tabulating the associated nodal
forces. Table A23.5 contains the nodal forces
appropriate to the loads shown in Fig. A~3.17.

Note that these nodal forces are related to the
fixed end moments used in the moment distribution method of Chapter All. The moments P 2
and P 4 are fixed end moments, while the reactions P", and P" may be obtained by statics.
For other cases of interest, the reader is referred to the information displayed in Chapter
All, Table All-l, herein, from which tile appropriate nodal forceR can be derived. Loadings
not appearing in the table can often be obtained
by superimposing the given cases.


A23.1O Structural Modeling Using Finite Elements


The process of structural modeling occurs
at several levels of abstraction during the
course of any design. Typically, one first has
a conceptual model, selecting the type of structure necessary to transmit the applied loads
from among many possibilities, including trusses,

ca~les, frames, arches, and shells. A more detailed model is necessary when making the design
drawings. One must detail connections and
brackets, size members based on available sheet
metal gages, and rolled or extruded sections,
actu.al material properties, etc. An analytical



model is required as well, relating to both the
conceptual and detail models, and reducing the
structure to a properly formulated mathematical
problem. The nwnbers produced by the solution
of the mathematical problem are then used to
verify the design concept and to provide a
rational basis for redesign, where necessary.
Finite element modeling is one method for producing a mathematical description of the structure. The next two sections comprise several
representative exmnple problems, intended to
provide the reader with an appreciation for the
nature of typical finite element models and the
kinds of results which can be obtained with them.

A finite element model of the structure
has been used, with each member represented by
a six by six stiffness matrix. This stiffness
matrix is found by combinIng results of cases A
and C of section A23.4 to provide the relation
between forces and displacements in one rotational and two translational coordinates at
each end of the member. Tnere are 12 elements
in the structure, connected at eight nodal
points. Thus the connectivity conditions at
the joints produce a reduction from 72 element
coordinates to 24 system coordinates. Finally,
applying two boundary conditions each at nodes
A and E, one finds there are 20 generalized
coordinates for this analysis. The system
description and loads were read into a digital
computer, programmed to solve the problem using
the method of Gaussian elimination.


The results of the analysis are shown in
Table A23.6. The effect of neglecting end fixity is slight for the axial forces. However,
the inclusion of induced bending moments in the
calculation of outer fiber stresses produces
large differences for several members. For example, the maximum stress in member BC is given
by (S/A) = 7320 psi for the truss analysis and
by (S/A) + (Me/I) = 11540 psi for the frame

The relative bending stiffnesses of the segments
are given on the figure. The frame is modeled
using beam elements, whose stiffness properties
are given by case C of section A23.4. The curved
portion of the frame is apprOXimated by 30
straight beam element~ (chordS), connecting
equally spaced nodal points located on the
elastic axis of the curved portion. Here the
model contains 32 elements, and, after accounting
for connectivity and boundary conditions, there
are 93 generalized coordinates in the system.
A computer solution was performed, again using
the Gaussian elimination method. As a check,
the computed values of reactions at point A have
been compared with results of an analysis given
in section A8.2.2. The equations obtained in
Chapter A8 are satisfied by the values M =
-27650 in.-lb., V = 801.3 lb., and T = 114.6 lb.,
with the sign conventions given in Fig. A8.3g,h,
i. The comparison is given in Table A23.7,
along with results for three other models, involving 15, eight, and four beam elements to
approximate the curved portion of the portal
frame, and one element for each column.

A23.16 ANALYSIS BY THE METHOD OF DISPLACEMENTS


The bending moment is plotted as a function of
position on the frame in Fig. A23.21. This
gives a good approximation for the spatial variation of outer fiber stresses, since bending is
the predominant type of deformation in this
problem.

plane of the free end. These end stresses
were set equal to the theoretical values at
the centers of the element faces for a resultant shear load of 4200n lb., equivalent to
an uniform vertical shear stress of 50 psi.
The interior stress distributions have been
derived from the theory of elasticity (7)
and are plotted along with computed values in
Fig. A23.25 and A2:3.26. Reported values for
each station represent averages of values for
the adjacent elements, referred to the midpoint of the bounding face. In the derivation
of these theoretical values, the nature of the
end condition at the wall is neglected. Thus,
the two results should show good agreement at
intermediate stations, but not near the wall.
These features are observed in Figs. A23.25
and A23.26. Near the wall, the finite element
model gives more realistic stress values,
based on the actual boundary conditions. This
is often true, especially in cases where the

analytical solution in closed form. Note that
the coarser nodal grid gives results comparable
in accuracy to those achieved with the refined
division using 144 elements. The decision regarding how many elements to use must be based
on experience with comparative studies of this
sort.

Grid Numbering Scheme



The torsional stiffness of the wing's shearcarrying cover sheet is accounted for by the
presence of quadrilateral "torque boxes" connecting points of intersection of the spars and
ribs. The resistance of a torque box having a
corner at, say, point 6 of the grid (e.g., box

box to keep all four corners in the same plane.
Obviously, three-cornered "boxes" have no such
resistance; hence none are shown in Fig. A23.27.



STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES SUMMARIZED



Obviously, three-cornered "boxes" have no such The properties of the structure (Fig.

Idealization, particularly with regard to
effective skin areas, has been discussed in
some detail by Levy (8). The complexities of
this phase of the problem are too great to permit an expansive treatment here.* Briefly,
Levy's recommendations are:


(a) all skin may be considered effective
between spanwise spars when computing the cap
areas of such spars. This assumption is subject to modification, of course, if spanwise
stresses are anticipated which will buckle the
skin.


(b) for streamwise ribs an effective width
of 0.362L, where L is the rib length, may be
taken as acting with each rib cap (Fig. A23.29a).


(c) for the leading edge spar an effective
width of skin of .181 of the span between spanwise spars is taken as acting with the cap of
each such spar segment (Fig. A23.29b).

Sec. A23.4.


CALCULATION OF ELEMENT STIFFNESSES


The element stiffness matrices are computed next for the beam segments and torque
boses. For the beam segments the equations of
Case D, Sec. A23.4 are used. The torque boxes
are treated expressly, below.


Beam Segment Stiffness Matrices


For the beam segments the spar between grid
points 2 and 5 typifies the calculation. From
the beam element properties given earlier, and
Fig. A7.34C


Ii/Ij = 0.281

~11 = [0.670]


<!lij = [0.480] ~ij/2 = [0.240]

~jj = 0.370


Then D2_ 5 = (0.670) (0.370) - (0.240)2 = 0.1903



In the case of the torque boxes, the stiffness matrices may be computed directly (they are
determinate). The following approximate analysis is suggested as being satisfactory for most
torque boxes. A more detailed analysis may be
in order for boxes with extreme geometries. An
alternate method is presented in Reference (8)
and an appropriate discussion may be found in
Reference (12). A completely different treatment of the cover skin is given in Reference
(10) .


Consider the quadrilateral box of Fig.

Fig. A23.30



For purposes of this immediate analysis, the
box is considered cantilevered from one end,
such as r-s. An elastic axis (e.a.) is assumed to exist midway between the long sides
and an "effective root" is employed. The
torque on the box is


T = Pm bm   - Pn bn


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-506-full.png)

A23.20 ANALYSIS BY THE METHOD OF DISPLACEMENTS



An (assumed) average rat;'J of twist, fl, is computed approximately by using the GJ at a representative section half way along the box.*


_ T _ Pmb rn    - Pnbn
fl- GJ   - GJ


Then the deflection on and Om are given by

= Pmbm     - Pnbn
GJ Lnb n


By summing moments about the effective root, Pn
is found in terms of Pm and ttwn eliminated
from the above equations to give


~Il = PmLmbm Lnbm + Lmbn
~ Ln


Since it is only the deflection of one
corner (say, point m) which is to be related to
the corner reactions, the box is now rotated
about the effective root axis to reduce on to
zero. The resulting total deflection of point
m is


0illTOTAL ::: ~n + ~ on


= PmLm (Lnbm + Lmb [n] ) (bn + bm)
GJ L n

Re-solving this, we write


GJ Ln
Pm ::: Lm(b n + bm) (Lnbm + Lmbn)


This last expression relates the load at
point m to the deflection at that point, with
the other three corners undeflected. Thus the
deflection of point m as defined was relative
to the plane mnr s. This relative displacement
may be related by geometry to the case where
all four corners are displaced (in effect, removing the rigid body displacements).

In the above derivation the torsional
stiffness GJ at a representative section is
used. The stiffness is obtained from Bredt's
equation for the twist of a single cell thinwalled tube (Eq. 18, Chapter A6)


T,[ ds

from which, by definition

GJ -¢ _ 4A -- ;s [2] G


Here A is the area enclosed within the tube
cross section by the median line of the tube
wall and the integration is carried out around
the tube perimeter (index s gives distance along
the perimeter). For the torque boxes encountered in delta wings it is probably satisfactory
to neglect the ds/t contribution from the vertical webs, it being small compared with the corresponding contribution from the cover sheets.


In the example wing three boxes (2-3-5-6,
3-4-6-7 and 6-7-8-9) are to be used. These
boxes are each 48 inches square in plan and
have average depths (assumed here to be the
uniform depths of the representative sections)
of 7.26", 5.32" and 4.27", respectively. Fig.

_A23.22_ ANALYSIS BY THE METHOD OF DISPLACEMENTS



Proceeding in the above manner, stiffness matrices for all 15 bea~ elements are transformed.
The torque boxes are already in "system" coordinates since each was designated by the grid
numbers of its four corners.


ANALYSIS BY SUBSTRUCTURES


From this point on the analysis proceeds in
a very direct manner as previously illustrated.
However, as is also apparent, any large structure having many nodal points is going to yield
a very high order matric equation when analyzed
in such a completely elemental fashion.


It is possible, however, to reduce the
order of the problem by some preliminary recombining of the elements into substructures in
the course of which one can


(a) use certain a priori information to
eliminate some loads (and corresponding displacements)


(b) extract some portions of the problem
out of the main calculation, putting them into
sUbproblems solved on the substructures.


These devices will be employed in the following
section.


Certain of the external loads associated
with the displacements of Fig. A23.32 are known
to be zero by nature of the load modeling used
in this problem. Thus, only transverse forces,
F 6 through F~o, are to be applied as loads at
the wing grid points, reacted by transverse
loads F~ through F4 and rolling moments F~~
through F~4 along the airplane centerline.


For this structure and this loading it is
then known a priori that many element loads are
zero. For example, there can be no couples on
the beam elements at grid point 10*. It is, in
effect, as if this joint was a pin joint and
only its translation was considered.


Many element loads are not zero but need
not be solved for explicitly in the main problem if they can be computed sUbsequently by
analysis of a substructure within which they are
subsumed. For example, the bending moments on
the beam elements 7-9 and 9-10 meeting at grid
point 9 are equal and may be found easily once
the transverse element load at point 10 is


The implication here is that beam torsional stiffnesses are
not considered in such interactions. This assumption is
probably quite satisfactory in general, bending stiffnesses
being much greater than torsional stiffnesses for most
beam elements. On occasion, a beam will have considerable
torsional stiffness and it will then be necessary to account
for it. The leading edge spar might be such a beam if it
replaces the "0" nose section of the wing in the idealization.



found on span 9-10. This situation suggests
that a single beam, continuous across grid
point 9, be used instead of the separate elements.


The substructures selected for this problem, along With their element deflections, are
shown in Fig. A23.33. They are the rather
natural choices of the continuous wing beams
(spars and ribs) with only the minimum necessary deflections considered. While the foregoing reasoning had dealt largely With forces,
it is the corresponding element displacements
Which are used as the variables and are soshown in the figure.

Substructures and Their Element Displacements.
Note numbering of displacements has been kept
consistent with system numbering of Fig. A23.32.


The substructure of spar 4-7-9-10 illustrates the motivation in the SUbstructure
variable choices. It was modeled as shown
since it was known there were no applied
couples at grid points 7, 9 and 10 and hence
the rotational displacements at those points
need not be considered. Elimination of
variables at no-load points can, of course be
done on the final complete system stiffness
matrix (obtaining a reduced stiffness matrix
per Equation 35). Such a reduction may involve manipulation of very large matrices.
Using substructures this reduction process is
divided into several smaller, more tractable
problems while simultaneously reducing the
order of the main problem. The rotational
displacements thus eliminated can be easily
obtained via a subcalculation, if desired,
(ref. Equation 33).

A23.24 ANALYSIS BY THE METHOD OF DISPLACEMENTS



hence three of the reactions expressed by the
structural equations in the matrix may be found
from the others by the equations of statics.
To remove the "singularity" from the stiffness
matrix it is only necessary to drop out three
equations - achieved by removing three rows and
corresponding columns (so as to retain a symmetric stiffness matrix).


The act of removing the three equations
selected is also equivalent to assuming the
corresponding deflections to be zero. In this
way a reference base for the deflections is also
established. The choice of reference base is
somewhat arbitrary, but, following a suggestion
of Williams (13), a triangular base will be
employed as shown in Fig. A23.34.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-510-0.png)


Fig. A23.34


Deflection Reference Base


Here the deflections at points 1 and 5 are zero,
fixing the reference triangle, since the point
corresponding to 5 in the other half of the wing
(say, 5' ), will have zero deflection also due to
symmetry. The third condition is applied to
point 2: point 2 will be assumed to have zero
rolling rotation (U~2 = 0) for symmetric wing
loadings and to have zero transverse deflection
(U2 = 0) for antisymmetric loadings.*


Hence the following equations (rows and
columns) are to be omitted from the wing stiffness matrix:


symmetric loadings

J for antisymmetrie loadings

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-510-2.png)


The 16 x 16 wing stiffness matrices thus
obtained can now be inverted as they are nonsingular. However, if this step is carried out
one finds that the resultant influence coef

The antisymmetric loading pattern is one wherein the wing
is loaded equally, but in opposite sense, on corresponding
points of the two wing halves. Any general loading may be
resolved into the sum of one symmetric and one antisymmetric loading.



ficients are those for only the half-wing
acting alone and supported by constraints as
asswned above. To account for the presence of
the other half of the wing, 'it is necessary to
specify additional geometric conditions along
the airplane centerline. This step is accomplished by asswning the following deflections
zero (eliminating their corresponding rows and
columns from the matrix):



u~~

u [2] "


U 24



J



for symmetric loadings (zero
lateral slope or rolling
rotation along the airplane
centerline)


for anti symmetric loadings (zero
transverse deflections and pitching rotations along the airplane
centerline



It will be seen that in both cases additional equations are eliminated from the 16 x
16 matrices further reducing them. In general
there is no reason Why the matrices for the
symmetric and antis~nmetric cases have to be
the same size since the modeling of applied
loads is not the sane in these cases (for example, no forces F~, F2, F" or F4 are applied
in an antisymmetric loading).


Written below is the 13 x 13 wing stiffness
matrix for the symmetric case (u~ = u e = u~~ =

U~2 = u~" = U~4 = 0). As explained earlier,
each entry therein is the sum of all corresponding stiffnesses for all elements meeting at the
point. A typical mUltiple entry occurs for
joint 6 - (row Fe, column ue ). These comprise:

REDUCED WING STIFFNESS MATRIX


The wing stiffness matrix as derived above
contains all the necessary geometric constraints
to represent correctly the wing behavior under a
symmetric loading. It may, however, be further
reduced by the application of certain zeroloading constraints which exist purely because
of the external load modeling used. Specifically, the load modeling sets the couples F 15,
F1B, F21, F26 and F 2B equal to zero. Hence
Equation 35 may be used to derive a reduced
matrix. This reduced matrix offers the advantages of simpler handling if the further
computing tasks of deriving wing influence coefficients (by inverting the wing stiffness
matrix) and internal wing stresses (i.e., specific element loads) are undertaken.


A23.12 Accuracy, Convergence and Error Bounds


We have to deal with two kinds of accuracy; first, the accuracy associated with the
finite element model; and second, the accuracy
associated with the numerical solution, once a

~odel has been chosen. It is worth pointing
out that the results although given by the computer to many decimal places may be useless,
due to a conceptual defect in the model, or a
computational defect in the solution.


Of the two processes, that of choosing a
finite element model is more dependent on experience and judgment. For some types of elements, convergence to an exact (theory of
elasticity or continuous) solution is assured
by taking a sequence of models with more and
more (smaller) elements. Exmnple problems 5
and 6 illustrate this situation. It may be
worthwhile to bound the desired result by considering limiting, simpler problems with similar
boundary conditions. In regions of high stress
and strain gradients, extreme care must be
taken in modeling and interpretation of results,
to assure obtaining useful values of stress and
deflection.



Concerning the numerical solution, the
stiffness matrix derived from the displacement
method is a positive definite symmetric matrix,
for which nontrivial, unique sol~tions can be
guaranteed a priori. The real difficulty lies
in finding a computationally efficient algorithm
for determining these solutions.


Several methods have been illustrated in
the example problems of this chapter, including
direct solution by inverting the stiffness
matrix (example problem 1) or by Gaussian
elimination (example problem 3), and solution by
iteration with a Gauss-Seidel algorithm (example
problem 2). As a rule of thumb, direct solution
is best for small, fUlly populated matrices,
while both types of solution are used for large,
sparsely populated matrices. The preferred
method of solution, and the demarcation between
large and small problems varies from authority
to authority, and in fact, the choice of method
may be overriden at a given facility by a reliable, debugged procedure of either type.
Problem bookkeeping should be optimized as well.
For example, where possible, modes should be
numbered to produce a banded stiffness matrix
to minimize storage requirements.


Certain practical measures may be employed
to facilitate numerical calculation. In the
case of one or more extremely stiff elements,
associated coordinates can be eliminated (as
in example problem 2) to yield better conditioning of the problem.


Computational errors arise from two
sources, termed roundoff error and truncation
error. Roundoff error occurs because a finite
number of digits are carried in the calculations; double precision arithmetic is often
necessary to avoid loss of significant figures.
In some algorithms, the order of operations is
altered by interchanging pairs of rows and
columns, again to avoid loss of significant
figures in subtraction and achieve better accuracy. Truncation error is typically associated with iteration methods, whose


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-512-full.png)

A23.26 ANALYSIS BY THE METHOD OF DISPLACEMENTS



accuracy is assured only by completing an infinite number of steps. By terminating the
calculations after a finite number of iterations,
we produce a truncation error. Further error
may be produced if the matrix coefficients are
obtained empirically. Placing bounds on the
errors is a difficult but important part of the
calculation procedure. For details, the reader
is referred to texts on the SUbject of numerical analysis (5,6).


A23. 13 Management of Problem for the Computer


A discussion of the management of a
structural problem for solution on an electronic
digital computer could easily occupy a separate
book. We will be content here to give the
reader a checklist of topics Which can be considered as a guide to the questions he should
consider and discuss with a computer consultant.
It is assumed that the desirability and feasibility of performing a computer analy8is have
already been determined, and the analytical
approach has been selected.


At this point the key factor is the cost of
the calculation for a given degree of accuracy.
The method employed, and thus the cost will be
intimately related to the rate structure at the
local computer facility. Often costs not central to the computation are the controlling
ones. A typical charge rate includes central
processor unit time, number of input-output
requests, and required storage region size.
Other factors, such as cost of cards and printed
output, tape and disk storage charges, graphic
plotter usage, etc., may be prorated or charged
directly. For a given computer, one of the
elements of the rate structure generally dominates the programming strategy. Earlier in the
evolution of computers, processing time and
storage were the limiting factors. With improvements in these areas, current computer
technology is often bound by input-output limitations. In addition to cost considerations,
the possibility of committing a blunder in data
inputting has led to use of special data generation routines and checking programs.
Graphical output is especially useful in detecting errors in nodal point location and in
checking element definitions. Because o~ input-output costs, it is desirable to keep as
much of the program in core storage as possible.
The cost of storing ann fetching information
may exceed the cost of regenerating data by a
factor of ten, twenty, or more. When moving
data in and out of the central processing unit,
the format used can have a critical influence
on cost. It is often advantageous to transfer
many record lines at a time using the simplest
format definition available.


Every program contains errors or bugs which
must be discovered and corrected before reliable



production runs can be performed. Use of online terminals operating on a time-sharing
system 1s an efficient way to debug, as it
eliminates most of the waiting time between
runs. This is especially useful during the
initial runs to discover spelling and syntax
errors. Often a machine failure will terminate
a run before completion. It is desirable to
output intermediate results so that something
is learned from every run. The amount of
running time for each portion of the program
can be checked easily, and can pinpoint those
parts of the calCUlations where reprogramming
would be most productive.


Once a program is ready for production,
it should be compiled and stored on tape or
disk in machine language rather than FORTRAN
or PL/I. This will save considerable time per
run. Where possible, established, widely used
programs should be used; with a new program
debugging represents a significant proportion
of the work required to produce results. However, one must beware of poorly documented
programs; the cost of the learning cycle could
easily exceed the cost of writing and debugging
a new program.

**INTRODUCTION TO**

**THE THEORY** **OF** **ELASTICITY** **AND** **THERMOELASTICITY**


**BY**

**CHAPTER** _**A24**_

**THE 3-DIMENSIONAL EQUATIONS** **OF** **THERMOELASTICITY**



**A24. 1 Assumptions:** There are two most important
assumptions in the classical theory of elasticity concerning the state of an elastic body
throughout its volume.


(i) The material is homogeneous.


(ii) The material is isotropic.


The first requires that the elastic body
possess the smne material properties at all
points throughout its volume and on the surface. When homogeneity does not exist, such
as in the case of an inclusion of foreign
material or of a laminated structure of
different material in each Imnination, the
mechanical and elastic constants become
functions of position in the body. This is
also the case where the material properties
become functions of temperature in a nonuniformly heated body.


The second requires that the elastic
properties are the smne in all directions at
any point in the elastic body. If a material
is non-isotropic, such as in extruded graphite
or laminated plastics, the relationships between stress and strain are no longer the
simple equations containing two independent
elastic constants. In the most general nonisotropic material it requires 21 elastic
constants to define the stress-strain relationship. The existence of ~lanes of elastic
symmetry reduces this number.(4j


A third important assumption is that the
displacements are so small that the position
of a point in the body does not require redefinition after deformation and that the
higher order terms of displacement derivatives
are negligible. If these assumptions are not
made the relationship between strains and displacements become non-linear and the much more
difficult theory of large deformations must be
employed.


The final assumption is that the material
behaves elastically. 'I'his assumption requires


**(4) Numbers in parentheses** **refer** **to the bibliography at the**
**end of the chapter.**



that a deformed body returns to its original
shape upon removal of the deformation source,
be it external loads or temperature. If one
considers the simple tension stress strain
curve, this assumption requires that at no point
in the body can the stress level be above the
yield point. If this stress level is exceeded
the problem again becomes non-linear since the
stress-strain relations no longer follow Hooke's
Law. This non-linear response is idealized in
the theory of plasticity. It is usual, also,
in the application of the classical theory of
elasticity to ignore the visco-elastic behavior
of materials but the extension to this case
where the stress-strain relations contain only
linear time derivatives of stress and strain
is quite straightforward. Since this type of
behavior, the best known of which is creep, becomes more pronounced as the temperature increases, this possible extension in the linear
case will be mentioned in Chapter A27.


The violation of these last two assumptions,
small deformations and linear stress-strain relations, leading to the non-linear problem
Where, of course, the rules of superposition no
longer apply, is mentioned not to cause confusion but to serve as a warning of the limitations of the theory presented herein.


**A24.2** **Formulation of the** **3-Dimensional** **Equations of**
**Thermoelasticity.**


The problem of thermoelasticity is to
determine at any point within and on the boundary of a heated elastic body subject to external
loads and constraints the stresses, strains and
displacements. The stress condition at any
chosen point within or on the boundary of the
body must be such that equilibrium of forces
and moments exists at that point. Consequently,
the expression of the equilibrium state of the
stress components will be independent of the
material properties, the deformations, the
temperature and temperature distribution, the
stress-strain law, etc. The relationship
between stress components must be only such as
to satisfy the equations of equilibrium. It is
well known that the stress at a point, being the
force intensity in a chosen direction, can be
represented by a single vector, haVing magnitude
and direction, which is related to a chosen cut

plane surface of infinitesimal area at that
point. Thus the definitions of the stress at
the point requires more than the statement of
the stress vector. It requires in addition
the definition of the cutting plane through
the point of interest to which the stress
vector is referred. The stress at a point can
be fully defined by choosing a Sllfficient nllillber of cuttl~g planes and determining the
stress vectors, usually defined by its components, associated with eaGh. In 3-diJlensional
bodies a minImum of 3 cutting planes which are
mutually at right angles to eaGh other (orthogonal) is reqUired. Thus, vlhen eacIl stress
vector associated with one of these cutting

pla~es is defined by its 3 comnonents, there
will exist 9 stress components to be determined. These 9 components of the stress at a
point mak [c] 3-up the stress tensor(4) which is
the most convenient representation for the
more difficult problems in theoretical analysis.
The three cutting planes are usually chosen
parallel to a chosen space fixed cartesian coordinate system, the choice usually clearly
indicated for the physical system under
analysis, and thus, the stress components will
all be parallel to this axis system. Other
axis systems such as cylindrical axes, can be
chosen so long as there is provided the 3
mutually perpendicular planes at the point of
interest. These 9 stress com~onents are
related by the equilibrium equations as shown
in the next section. There will be 6 equations
of eqUilibrium and thus there eXists more unknowns (9) than there are equations which fact
prevents any possible general solution.


Under the influence of this stress field
the elastic body will deform in a manner dependent upon the stress strain relations. The
stress strain relations for the isothermal
problem (the same temperature througllOut) are
well known from the linear Hook's **Law.** **(2,3,4)**
The introduction of temperature modifies these
relations by the addition of another strain
component due to the thermal expansion
properties of the material being studied.
These stress-strain relations provide 6 more
equations but at the same time 6 additional
unknown strain components are introduced. The
system of equations is still inc~nplete.


The strains Give rise to displacements.
The relationship between strains and displacements which are independent of temperature and
temperature distribution requires 6 equations
for definition and at the same time introduces
only 3 unlmowns which are the displacement
components.


The number of unknowns is now 18 and there
exists 18 equations so that the equation set is
complete and a general solution is possible.
This general solution will be the unique



solution when all 18 equations are simUltaneously satisfied. The development of the
solution to a specific problem requires a set
of boundary condition equations for evaluation
of the unknown coefficients existing in the
general solution.


As in the theory of elasticity, the solution to a chosen physical problem in thermoelasticity must satisfy the defined 18 equation
set and, as well, the boundary conditions.
The equations of thermoelasticity are derived
in the following sections in the following

sequence.


(A) Equilibrium Equations


(B) Strain    - Displacement Relations


(c) Stress-Strain Relations


(D) Boundary Conditions


It should be noted at this time that the
only change that is necessary in the equations
of the linear theory of elasticity to the linear
theory of thermoelasticity is in the stressstrain relations.


**A24.3** **The** **Equilibrium Equations.**


Consider the point 0 in an elastic body
which is SUbject to external loading and internal, or body, forces. It is desired to determine the state of stress at **O.** This could be
done completely by defining the resultant stress
tensor with respect to some spatial reference
but is most commonly done in the following manner. Take the point of interest 0 as the origin
of three mutually perpendicular axes oriented
parallel to a chosen spatial cartesian axis
system. The choice of this reference axis
system is usually clearly indicated by the
geometry of the system under study.

rections of these components as those of the
axis system.


For example, consider the cutting plane
yz. The resultant stress vector at 0 associated with this cutting plane can be defined by
the three components ax; ~xy; ~xz where


ax component normal to the zy plane
and therefore parallel to the
x - axis, hence the subscript x


~xy = one of the stress components in the
yz plane which is identified by the
normal direction x, hence the first
subscript, and in the y direction
as indicated by the second subscript. This component could be
written as ~(yz)y but since the
axes are mutually perpendicular the
yz plane is more economically
identified by the subscript x as
shown.


~xz = the other in-plane component at
right angles to ~xy where again the
first subscript identifies the
cutting plane yz and the second the
direction.


With the adoption of a sign convention
these vector components can be considered
scalar quantities. Associated with the cutting
plane xz will be the components Oy, ~yx, ~yz
and with the cutting plane xy the components
0z, ~zx, ~zY' Any other of the infinitely
many possible cutting planes passing through 0
can be defined in terms of coordinates associated with the three mutually perpendicular
planes xy, xz, yz. Thus, definition of the 9
stress components ax, Oy, oz, ~xY' ~xz, ~yx,

~yz, ~zx' ~zy will completely define the stress
condition at the point 0 in the body. The
magnitudes of these vector components will be
obtained from the solutions of the differential
equations of equilibrium, stress-strain and
strain-displacement relations and the boundary
conditions, wherein the components are treated
as scalar quantities since the sign convention
illustrated in the next section is always
implied and the direction is that of the
chosen cartesian coordinate system.


To establish the equations of equilibriun
the fundamental laws of statics are employed,
viz;


ZF x = ZF y = ZF z = ZM o = 0


where Fx indicates a force in the direction x,
etc., and Mo a moment about O.


Since it is forces which satisfy this



equation, surface areas over which the stresses
(being force intensities) are acting must be
provided. This is most conveniently done by
considering the stress components acting over
the faces of a small parallelepiped constructed
with faces in or parallel to the cutting planes
contained in the cartesian coordinate system
with the point of interest 0 as the origin.
This parallelepiped is considered arbitrarily
small and in the limit as the edge dimensions
approach zero the equations resulting from
equilibrium of the element will describe the
stress conditions at the point O. Consider
then such a parallelepiped which is already
considered infinitesimally small with edge
dimensions then correctly specified as dx, dy
and dz. The stress components on those faces


z



![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-517-0.png)

contained in the cutting planes xz, xy and yz
are shown according to the positive sign convention. According to this same sign convention
the stress components on those faces parallel
to the cutting planes are shown in the next
figure. It is these components which are of
interest from the physical interpretation of the
stress condition at 0 since, because of the
limiting process mentioned above, it is these
directions which are indicated by positive
values in the solution to the differential
equations of equilibrium. It is observed that
positive values of ax, Oy and Oz indicate
tension of the elastic material at the point O.

When in doubt during the physical interpretation of solutions to the equations of elasticity one should return to these two figures
which define the positive sense of the stress
components.


The stress components have all been increased an amount equal to the rate change of
magnitude in the direction of movement times
the di~tance moved. This increase is, of
course, the change in magnitude between the
components on the planes passing through 0
and those displaced an infinitesimal distance
away in the positive direction. In this
volume element, dxdydz, it will also be
possible to have body forces X, Y, Z defined
as the force per unit volume and which can
arise as gravitational forces, magnetic
forces, etc., acting in the direction x, y
and z respectively and through the centroid
of the volume element. It should be borne
in mind that these are internal forces within
the element considered and are distinct from
the external forces which will appear in the
equations defining the boundary conditions.


The equations of equilibrium are obtained
directly from the static equilibrium conditions:


ZFx = 0

The equations 2, 3, 4 and the three equations
of 5 make up the 6 eqUilibrium equations. In
the following discussions equations 5 will be
accepted and thus the preceding discussion on
the equation set of 18 must be modified to the
set of 15 with a similar reduction of 3 in the
number of unknowns.


It should be noted that these equations
2, 3 and 4 define the equilibrium state of the
volume element and their derivation requires
no limiting assumptions as to the elastic
nature of the material. The equations are thus
quite general and will be the same for nonlinear systems and those in which displacements
are created by temperature differences. For
convenience, these eqUilibrium equations are
written in cylindrical coordinates r, Q and z.

THE 3-DIMENSIONAL EQUATIONS OF THERMOELASTICITY A24.5



A24.4 Strain - Displacement Relations.


Equations 2, 3, and 4 being three
equations with six unknowns are insufficient
to establish solutions for these unknowns
ox, Oy, Oz, ~xy, ~xz, ~yz. One looks therefore to equations relating the stresses to the
deformations of the deformable elastic body
for the further equations necessary to provide
a complete set. Consider first the strain
displacement relations. The discussion of
the relation between these strains and the
stresses will follow.


If a fictitious fiber of unit length lies
in the positive x - direction before deformation, one has only to determine the increase
in length of this fiber after deformation to
obtain the strain at the point of origin of
the fiber. With the assumption that this
change in length is sufficiently small that
second order terms of this change can be
neglected and further, that rotation of this
fiber away from the x - direction is
small, it is easy to show by simple trigonomE:try that the strain EX is given by

those two projections in the x-y plane starting from the point of interest 0 in the body.

A24.6 AN INTRODUCTION TO



developed since many structural problems, such
as the buckling and post-buckling behavior of
structures, involve large deformations.


We now possess a set of 9 equations, the
3 equations of equilibrium and the 6 straindisplacement relations, with the 15 unknowns
ox, Oy, oz, ~xy, ~yz, ~xz, Ex, Ey, EZ, ~xy,

~yz, t xz, u, v, w so the equation set is even


more incomplete than before. However, by
means of the stress-strain relations, Hooke's
Law, the equation set will be completed to 15.


A24. 5 Stress-Strain Relations.


In accord with the limiting assumptions
of the linear theory of elasticity the general
statement of Hooke's Law requires 36 constants
in the isothermal problem. For isotropic
materials, wherein the elastic properties at
any chosen point throughout the body are
the same for all possible directions of observation, these 36 constants are readily
shown to be dependent(l, 2, 3, 4) and can be reduced to the two most commonly used, E,
Young's modulus and V, Poisson's ratio, or the
Lame constants A and~. For the isothermal
problem the stress-strain relations can be
written as;


EX = i ~x [-] [ Y(Oy] [ +] oz~


Ey = i ~y [-] [ y(oz] [ +] [ oxTI]

Ez -If    - 1 G Oz    - Y(Oy + oxTI


1
txy =Cf'T;xy

lI'xz =Cf~xZ


where E = Young's modulus = slope of the uniaxial stress strain

curve


G = shear modulus = 2(1 ~ Y)


_v_ = Poisson's ratio = 0.3 for steel


= 0.25 -. 0.50 for
all elastic materials at room

temperature.


It is often more convenient to express the
stress strain relations with the Lame constants of linearity. In three-dimensional
elasticity these relations become



Ox = Ae + 2~EX


Oy = Ae + 2fl£y


Oz = [Ae] [ +] 2fl£z


~xy [=] ~dxy


~yz = I!Syz


~zx = \-I- [7f] zx


where the Lame constants


liE
_A.=_
(1 + )/) (1 - 2)1)


E _

\-I- = 2(1 + y ) - G


and


e = EX + Ey + EZ = the dilatation of the
volume element.


It should be further noted that


3..\ + 2\-1- = 3k


where


k = -..,.---=E=------,3(1     - _2V)_


In the case of the heated elastic body
these strain expressions must be modified by
the addition of a component arising from the
thermal expansion property of all structural
materials. This component will be proportional
to the temperature level, T, above or below
some reference temperature (usually room temperature). The constant of proportionality is the
familiar linear coefficient of thermal expansion, which, for isotropic materials is the
same in all directions of observation at the
point O. It is obvious that the direct strain
components, Ex' Ey, EZ' being the change in
length per unit length of a fictitious fiber
oriented in the x, y, z directions respectively,
are directly affected by the thermal expansion.
The shear stress components will not, however,
be affected for isotropic materials since the
angular deformation of a small volume element
located at 0 will not be changed during the
uniform expansion of this volume element. The
stress-strain relations for thermoelasticity
thus become:

EX = i ~x   - y(Oy + oz] + aT   - - - - (12)


Ey = i ~y    - )/(ox + oz] + aT    - - - - (13)

These equations can be inverted to express
the stresses as functions of strains. This 1s
left as an exercise for the student but these
relations containing the Lame constants are
given here for completeness of treatment.

where the definitions of).., fJ, and e remain unchanged from those previously given in the
isothermal equations relating stress and
strain.


A24.6 The General Equations of 3-Dimensional
Thermoelasticity.


The unknowns are:


6 stress components ox,oy,oz,'rxy,'txz,'tyz
6 strain components EX,Ey,Ez,txy,txz,tyZ
3 displacement components u, v, w
15


The necessary 15 equations are given by


3 equations of equilibrium

The equation set is now complete since the
number of independent equations is equal to the
number of unknowns.


A24.7 The Compatability Equations.

It will be noted in the strain displacement
equations that 6 strain components are necessary
to define the 3 displacement components. Thus,
if one were to choose at random a set of 6
strain components this does not mean that there
eXists a possible set of 3 displacement components which will allow satisfaction of the straindisplacement equations.

Consequently the choice of these 6 strain
components cannot be arbitrary and, in fact,
must be such that the compatability equations,
which are equations relating the derivatives of
the strain components, are satisfied. These
compatability equations thus ensure the existence of continuous single-valued displacement
functions. This, of course, ensures the uniqueness of the solution when, as is possible, the
analysis is formulated in terms of stresses and
strains only. These equations are automatically
satisfied if the complete 15 equation set is
satisfied.

These equations are derived in the following manner.

From equation 9

or from equations 6 and 7

d"'"/ xy = d [2] E:x + ~

The remaining 5 compatability equations
are derived in similar manner and the complete
set appears as follows

d [2] i5 xz _ ~ + d [2] E:z

ing these boundary conditions
would be a general 3-dimensional
elastic body subjected to hydrostatic pressure or the same body
non-unifonnly heated. In the

complete first example the surface

tractions are the pressure levels

(18) acting normal to the surface and

in the latter the surfaces are
traction free (the boundary
tractions all zero). If the surface tractions at any point on
the surface are represented by

- - - the vector components X, Y, Z
(20)

parallel to the x, y, z axes
respectively, the equations of
eqUilibrium at the boundary give

- - - (21) the boundary condition equations:

OZ2 oyoz oxdz dXdy

As will be noted later, these compatability equations are automatically satisfied
if the problem is formulated in terms of d.isplacements and then the general solution must
satisfy only the equilibrium equations with
these equations written in terms of displacements. In comparison, if the problem is
formulated completely in terms of stresses
then both the equilibrium and the compatability
equations must be satisfied. The 3 eqUilibrium
and the 6 stress-strain relations togetrler with
the 6 compatability equations again provide a
complete set of equations for the general
soLltion to a problem formulated in terms of
stresses and strains only.

It now remains only to obtain the specific
solution to this complete set of equations for
the chosen physical problem. This requires
the use of the equations which state the
boundary conditions into which the general
solution is substituted to obtain a set of
algebraic equations from which the unknown
constants of the general solution can be
evaluated.


**A24.8** Boundary Conditions

It is obvious that the boundary conditions
can be prescribed in three different possible
ways. Consider each case in turn.

Case 1. All external boundary conditions
are prescribed in terms of external surface loads with no
geometrical restraints imposed.
Since the derived equations are
in terms of stresses, these loads
are converted to load intensities (lb. force/unit area) and
are then termed surface tractions.
Simple examples of a system hav


Case 2.


Case 3.



X = Gx l + 'Lxyill + 'Lxzn


Y = Gym + 'Lyzn + 'Lxyl - - - (24.)


Z = Gzn + 'Lxzl + 'Lyzm


where 1, m, n are the direction
cosines of the surface normal

drawn outward from the surface.


All external boundaries are constrained by geometrical restraints
and thus, all boundary displacements are specified. This case is
relatively rare in engineering
structures. A simple example
would be that of a heated insert
fully contained within a rigid
body. If the boundary displacements are specified ov~r the whole
boundary, the boundary conditions
can be written as:


u = f(s)



where s is the surface point and
f, g, and h are known functions
prescribed by the specified displacements.


The boundary conditions are specified by stresses over part of the
surface and by displacements over
the remainder. A simple example
is that of a heated cantilever
wing where the assumption of a
rigid root fixity prescribes zero
displacements at the root while
over the remainder of the structure

surface the surface tractions are
zero, for the unloaded wing, or



v = g(s)


w = h(s)

THE 3-DIMENSIONAL EQUATIONS OF THERMOELASTICITY A24.9



prescribed by the external loading. This problem is discussed
in some detail later in the text
of Chapter A25. Both sets of
equations stated in the above
two cases must then be used
where appropriate.


A24.9 General Notes.


Only the linear theory of thermoelasticity
is being considered herein and consequently
the rules of superposition apply. This means,
of course, that one can determine the stresses,
strains and displacements of an elastic
structure due to one of several causes and
add the results of each cause treated independently to determine the stresses, strains
and displacements due to all the causes acting
simultaneously. In the thermoelastic analysis
of heated loaded structures it is frequently
most convenient to determine the stress, strain
and displacement distribution due to temperature alone and to then add to this result the
isothermal analysis of the loaded structure
according to the well documented theory of
elasticity to obtain the final distribution.
In determining the stress, strain and displacement due to temperature one can rightly
consider all surfaces to be traction free so
long as, in the isotl18rmal analysis, deformations at geometrical restraints due to the
temperature are restored to the prescribed
values by such boundary condition equations as:


u = f(s)



v = g(s)


w = h(s)



- - - - - - - - (26)



The functions uT, vT, wT will be the
boundary displacements calculated from the
thermoelastic analysis considering all surfaces free of tractions.


This technique has the distinct advantage
that the thermoelastic problem can then always
be formulated in terms of stresses only,
leaving the mixed boundary condition problem
to the isothermal analysis. It will be seen
later, however, that this is not always advantageous and it is often desirable to retain
the prescribed boundary displacement conditions
in both the thermal and isothermal analyses.
Unfortunately no rules of choice can be given
and the decision must be made by the analyst
based on his own experience. The examples to
be considered in the next chapter will assist
in this choice however.


Mention is made in the above of a stress
formulation. This point deserves clarification.
The fifteen equations of the 3-dimensional



theory of elasticity and thermoelasticity
contain the 15 unknown stress, strain and displacement components. If the boundary conditions are, as in Case 1 of the preceding
section, given by surface tractions only, the
boundary condition equations contain 6 stress
components. It is then desirable to formulate
the 15 equations in terms of 6 stress equations.
These will be the 3 equilibrium equations and
the first 3 compatability equations written in
terms of stresses by use of the stress-strain
and strain-displacement relations. The remaining 3 compatability equations must also be
satisfied to ensure a unique solution. The
specific solution is obtained in terms of
stresses only from the set of 9 equations and
the 3 boundary condition relations. This
formulation is the one employed in the thermal
stress analysis where all surfaces are considered traction free. It is important to
remember that in this stress formulation the
equations of equilibrium and compatability
(written in terms of stresses) must be satisfied simultaneously by the general solution.


If, on the other hand, the boundary conditions are those of Case 2 then the boundary condition equations contain only 3 known displacements. The problem is then formulated in terms
of .displacements. Since, by the choice of
displacements over the boundary, the equations
of compatability are automatically satisfied it
remains only to obtain a solution of the 3
eouations of equilibrium which have been rewritten in terms of displacements, again by the
use of the stress-strain and strain-displacement
relations. Unfortunately, as stated before,
this most desirable case rarely exists in
engineering analysis.


If the boundary conditions are of the mixed
type of Case 3 then no one formulation is the
more desirable.

CHAPTER _A25_

**THE 2-DIMENSIONAL EQUATIONS** **OF** **ELASTICITY**
**AND** **THERMOELASTICITY**



A25.1 mtroduction: In any elastic body wherein
the stress components at a point of interest
all lie in the one plane and, due to symmetry
in the body itself or in the external loading,
the stresses throughout the body all lie in
this one plane, the stress analysis becomes
2-dimensional. All stresses normal to this
plane are zero. The analysis is then referred
to as one of plane stress.


In the same manner, if all strains lie in
one plane (all strain components normal to the
plane being zero) the problem is again two
dimensional and the analysis is referred to as
one of plane strain.


The restriction to a planar surface is,
of course, not necessary and the statement of
the 2-dimensional problem of stress or strain
should be generalized to that wherein the
general 3-dimensional equations can be reduced
to a 2-dimensional form by the possible neglect
of the stress or strain components parallel to
one of the axes of reference.


The equations for plane stress are different from those of plane strain and, consequently, each in turn is treated in the following development.


In the following development the equations
of thermoelasticity are derived and discussed.
The equations of elasticity follow directly by
deletion of all terms containing the temperature, T.


A25.2 Plane Stress.


For illustrative purposes only, the discussion is limited to a physical problem of
such geometry that the system is best defined
by a cartesian coordinate system. The extension to a system defined by cylindrical or
spherical coordinates follows directly.


With the above limitation, the plane
stress problem requires that all stress components parallel to one of the axes are zero.
Let this axis be the z-axis. Then

restrained and where the temperature does not
vary through the thickness as illustrated in
Fig. A25.1. The problem of the thin cantilever
wing with no temperature variation through the
thickness is a physical system satisfying this
statement as is the isothermal problem of a
simple cantilever beam. Both of these examples
will be discussed in some detail in Chapter A26.

to the following:

Where the statement of there being only the two
displacement components u and v is an assumption
consistent with that of the thin slice where the
edge loadings are symmetric about the middle
surface so that no bending displacements out of
the plane occur. This required symmetry of
loading for the plane stress formulation must
be carefully considered in those systems defined
by cylindrical or spherical coordinates such as
in the problems of thin cylindrical and spherical shells.


The 8 equations, necessary for a general
solution, can be derived directly from the pre

The equation set is complete for the

compatability equation required for uniqueness
of solution from a stress formulation. The
expression for EZ is not usually included in
the completed set since it results directly
from the solution of this set and is given by,

The compatability equation is given by

surface forces per unit area in the directions

Case 2, displacement boundary conditions

usual to assume X = Y = o.


u = f(s)



The discussion of Chapter A24 applies to
these boundary conditions and should be studied
again if necessary. This discussion outlines
the usual procedure of treating the thermal
stress problem in stress formulation with all
surfaces traction free and then determining the
effect of external loads and removal of thermal
displacements where prescribed by means of an
isothermal analysis.


**A25.3** **Derivation of Equations.**


For those to whom this sUbject is new it
will be well to derive, in this section, the
complete equation set in some more detail.
These derivations can be found in any text in
the theory of elasticity and are repeated here
merely for the convenience of the reader. In
many two-dimensional stress problems it is
necessary to develop the strain-displacement
relations from fundamental consideration of
possible deformation in space of a chosen fiber
so that special attention should be paid to the
development of the most simple case presented
here.


The equations of equilibrium.


Consider the figure shown in Chapter A24
on which the positive stress components are
shown for an element extracted from a threedimensional body. If one were to view this
figure from the z-axis in a positive z-direction
the following figure would be observed.

For the plane stress problem the stress components shown are all that will be acting
since, by definition, the stress components
out of the x-y plane are zero. The equations
of equilibrium are then readily derived by
summing the forces in the x and y direction,
remembering that the figure actually represents a plan view of a three-dimensional element of depth dZ, and equating this algebraic
sum to zero.

Now, if the material is isotropic it follows
that the directions of principal stress are
also the directions of principal strains. The
relationship between principal stresses and

Again, from the assumption of isotropy, which
states that the elastic properties are the same
in all directions at a point in the elastic
body, it follows that since the principal
direction SUbscripts can be arbitrarily prescribed a complete interchange of subscripts
can be made. Thus it follows that

The stress-strain relations.


Consider the elastic isothermal problem.
The generalized statement of Hooke's Law pro
v~des that each of the independent components
of stress (Ox, 0y, 'Lxy) may be expressed as a
linear function of the strain components
(EX' Ey, Cxy) and visa versa. Thus follows
the mathematical expressions,


Ox = aJ.J. EX+ a:l." Ey + 1\3 [txy]

If, however, as is generally the case, the
coordinate directions are not the principal
directions then shear stresses and strains will
exist simultaneously with the direct extensions.
The shear strain 1s independent of the direct
extensions and is related to the shear stress
by the relation

Thus, in the general case where the coordinate axes are not the principal axes the
two-dimensional equations relating stress and
strain can be written


txy = ~ 't"xy


If the elastic body is heated it should be
obvious that the small element under consideration will expand uniformly and the resulting
deformation due to temperature T will be equal
direct extensions aT, where _a_ is the linear
coefficient of thermal expansion, in both the
x and y directions. The shear strain component
will be unaffected. Thus the thermoelastic
stress strain relations in the plane stress
problem can be written as,

Strain - Displacement Relations.


Consider a point, 0, in an elastic twodimensional body. Under the influence of
external loads and temperature differences
this point will be displaced to a new position

O~ through the displacement components u and v.
As discussed in Chapter A24, it is a necessary
assumption of the linear theory of elasticity
that these displacements be sufficiently small
that no redefinition of the point 0 is required after deformation or that the squares
and products of their derivatives may be
neglected. The strain-displacement relations
are derived by consideration of the deformation
of a fiber oriented originally in the direction
of the chosen component direction.


Consider the figure below,
Y **or.**

The figure shows an unstrained fiber O_OJ.
located in the elastic body at the point 0 and
at known orientation With respect to the axes
x and y. Upon deformation of the body the fiber
takes up the new position OJ.-O~. The original
length of the straight fiber is dr and the
length in the displaced position becomes dr +
edr. The quantity e is known as the strain of
the fiber. The end displacements of the fiber
are u, v and uJ.' vJ. as shown. These end displacements are related by the equations


uJ. = u [+] [ au] [ 1] dr [+] [ au] [ m] dr
ax ay


av
VJ. = [v] +-1 dr [+] [ av] [ m] [ dr]
ax ay


where 1 and m are the direction cosines of the
fiber. The coordinates of <\are u and v. The
coordinates of OJ. are 1 dr and m dr. The coordinates of O~ are


1 dr + uJ.
and m dr + vJ.


Thus the projection of the strained fiber
on the x-axis is given by


ldr + uJ.    - U = ldr + ~~ ldr + ~~ mdr


and along the y-axis by


av av
mdr + (v J.   - v) = mdr + ax ldr + ay mdr


From the right angle triangle it follows

that


(dr + edr) = '" (ldr + ax au ldr + aymdr) au "


av av '"
+ (mdr + ax ldr + ay mdr )


which leads to


e = 1'" au + m'" av + 1m (au + av )
ax ay ay ax


Thus the strain of any fiber of a given
orientation can be found if the derivatives of
displacements are known. Consider the strain
in the x-direction. This is obtained by considering a fiber originally aligned with the
x-axis. In this case 1 = 1, m = 0 and


Similarly the strain in the y-direction is
given by

THE 2-DIMENSIONAL EQUATIONS OF ELASTICITY AND THERMOELASTICITY A25.5



av
ey = ay


au av
The term ay + ax is known as the shear

strain. The physical meaning can be seen by
consideration of a fiber oriented at an angle
of 45 [0] to the x-y axis system and therefore
subtending an angle of 90 [0] at the origin.
It is left as an exercise to prove then that

au + av is the reduction in this subtended
ay ax
angle when the fiber is strained. This
physical picture is, perhaps, better understood by reference to the figure below.

It should be noted that the general expression for strain, e, can now be rewritten
in terms of ex, ey and txy as follows,


e = 12 ex + m [2] ey + 1m txy


which is exactly analogous to the direct stress
expression on a cutting plane oriented at an
angle to the x-y axis system, viz:


a = 12 0x + m [2] 0 y + 1m 'txy    

It is readily verified, therefore, that
the directions of principle stress coincide
with the direction of principal strains.


A25.4 Formulation of Plane stress Problem.


(a) stress Formulation    - All boundary
conditions given in terms of surface tractions.


The 2 eqUilibrium equations are already written in terms of the 3 stress components OX> Oy, 't xy • The compatability equation
is given by 25.12. The equations which must
therefore be satisfied by the three unknowns
ox, Oy, 'txy are:



when both E and a are independent of the
temperature, T, and position in the body. The
derivation of this compatability equation in
terms of stresses is left as an exercise for
the stUdent.


The specific solution to a problem in this
formulation requires those values of ox, Oy and
'txy which satisfy the above 3 equations and the
boundary condition equations of 25.14.


When X = Y = 0 (body forces not present)
or when these body forces can be represented by
a potential function, V, in the following manner


X =- - axav, Y =   - ayav 25.18


the inverse solution technique usually proves
the most profitable. Since, in the linear
problems of elasticity and thermoelasticity, the
stress formulation occurs most frequently this
inverse approach is illustrated here in some
detail. This approach is not restricted to the
plane stress problem now under discussion and
can be applied equally as well to plane strain
or any two-dimensional stress formulations.


In general, one can choose a stress function
¢ defined by the relations


a 2 ¢
Ox =~
ay


_ a [2] ¢
0y   - ax [2] 25.19


This function ¢ is commonly referred to as the
Airy stress function since Airy first applied
this well known mathematical technique to
problems in elasticity.


It is obvious that the equilibrium
equations are automatically satisfied by 0 When
chosen according to 25.19. To obtain a general
solution for the stresses it remains, therefore,
to solve only the compatability equation, 25.17,
which, when written in terms of 0, becomes



and

general solution is obtained (equivalent to
equation 25.20 when the body forces are considered zero).


The stress function, 0, is defined by the
equations



and E and _a_ are not functions of temperature.
The general solution for 0 is obtained by
solving 25.20 or 25.21 for a given temperature
distribution. The general solution for
stresses follows directly from 25.19. The
specific solution is obtained by substitution
into 25.14, the boundary conditions. = _~ (l.-a0)
ar r a9



In this case, where the boundary conditions
are those of traction free boundary conditions,
the equation 25.14 can be written in terms of
o as


0=0



and the compatability equation becomes


This reduction of the 3-dimensional case
to the 2-dimensional plane stress problem can
be generalized to an eqUivalent problem which
includes the case where the temperature varies
through the plate or slice thickness, t, by
employing the equations


'Lxz = 'Lyz = 0 25.24


at the upper and lower surfaces. The equations
are analogous to 25.1. This equation requires
that the stress components, the temperature,
the displacements and the edge loadings be
taken as average values across the thickness.
For example, the temperature would be written

as


T = f [t ] / [2 ] Tdz
-t/2


The quantities 'Lxz, 'L yz ' 0xz' 0YZ and w must be
SUfficiently small across the thickness that
they can be neglected. This is not the exact
plane stress problem and some care must be taken
in its application as will be demonstrated in
Chapter A26. The results will be average values
of ax, 0y' 0xy' EX' Ey, U, v across the thickness.


(b) Displacement Formulation    - The bound


and a0 = 0

25.22



where n is - the outward drawn surface normal at
all points on the boundary. ThUS, the specific
solution can be obtained in terms of 0 directly
and the specific solutions for ox, oy, and
~y by direct substitution into 25.19.


It should be noted that in this case of
traction free boundary conditions there will
exist no thermal stresses at all if the
temperature distribution is such as to satisfy
the equation


v"T = 0 25.23


and body forces do not eXist. ThUS, if T is
constant or a linear function of x and y, no
thermal stresses will reSUlt.


It is wise to repeat at this time that if
there is any displacement restraint placed on
the boundaries, stresses due to the restraint
of thermal strains will result even though T
is such as to satisfy the equation V"'T = O.
(See discussion in Chapter A24).


It is convenient, at this pOint, to present the definition of the stress function for
cylindrical coordinates (equivalent to equation
25.19 and obtained therefrom by the simple
transformation from the x-y plane to r-9 plane
With z the axial direction.

ary conditions given in terms of boundary displacements. By choosing the displacement
formulation the compatability equation is automatically satisfied. The general solution for
the two displacements u and v are obtained
from the two equilibrium equation written in
terms of displacements as follows:


E a (au + av) E 'V,.
2(I-Y) ax ax ay + 2(I+V) u


         - ---+x=o aE aT
(l-Y) ax
25.25

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-531-0.png)


where, again, E, _a_ and Yare constants. These
equations are derived directly by the substitution of equations 25.4, .5, .6, .7, .8 and .9
into equations 25.2 and .3.


The specific solution is obtained by
sUbstituting the general solution into the
boundary condition equations, 25.15, and
solving for the unknown constants.


_A25._ 5 Plane Strain.


The plane strain problem requires that no
displacement exists in one of the coordinate
axes directions, say the z-direction. Thus
w = 0 and u and v are functions of x and y
only. This is equivalent to requiring that
the following strain components are zero,


25.26


It follows that the 8 unknowns will be ox, Oy,

~XY' txy, EX' Ey, U and v. In this case of
plane strain Oz will be a function of ox and oy
and is, therefore, not considered as an unknown. The substitution of 25.26 into the 15
equations of A24, reduces the number of independent equations to 8, the two equilibrium
equations, the 3 stress-strain relations and
the 3 strain-displacement relations. Thus the
equation set is complete.


The condition that w = 0, displacements
normal to the x-y plane do not exist, requires
that any cut surface originally lying in the
x-y plane remains parallel to this plane after
deformation. One such physical system in
which this situation will exist is that of a
long cylindrical body subjected to external
loads and temperature which are independent of
the z, or axial, component and all loads and
body forces act normal to the axial direction
(i.e. all loading lies in the x-y plane and is
independent of axial position in the body.)
Such systems are common in missiles and rockets
(the cylindrical shell body, the solid fuel



grain, the rocket nozzle) atomic reactors
(cylindrical fuel rods, heat exchanger tUbes)
etc.


~he question of whether a system under
analysis can be considered one of plane stress
or one of plane strain is frequently raised and
should be answered at this point. One must
consider the system carefully and check as to
whether all the requirements pertinent to one
or the other states has been satisfied. If any
have not then the problem is essentially a 3dimensional one and the 15-equation set must be
employed. However, in some cases, this decision
is not a clear cut one. Consider, for example,
the case of a cylindrical shell of finite
length h, of diameter b, and which is loaded
normal to its axis, body forces are zero and
temperature is independent of the axial coordinate. If one considers the ratio of length
to diameter, hlb, the problem can be classified
as follows


h
» 1 plane strain
b


h
« 1 plane stress
b


h
1 3-dimensional
b


It should be noted, that in actual fact, the
plane stress problem is a three-dimensional
strain problem and the plane strain problem one
of three-dimensions in stress due to the
possible presence of EZ in the first and Oz in
the secon<Q

The distinction between plane stress and
plane strain problems is clearly portrayed by
comparison between figures 25.1 and 25.2.


By direct substitution of 25.26 into the
general equations of Chapter A24 the following

of course, is never done.

If the surface tractions are prescribed

Case 2 must be applied where appropriate.


However, it is repeated here for emphasis
that the linear thermoelastic analysis is usually
broken down into a thermal stress analysis
assuming all surfaces unrestrained and traction
free, and upon the results of this part is
superimposed an isothermal analysis in which
the effect of external loading and satisfaction
of prescribed boundary displacements is taken
into account.

This is, of course, non-zero and therefore this
boundary condition is not satisfied under the
assumption of traction-free surfaces and only
by the most rare chance would this coincide
with a prescribed applied surface traction.
This apparent surface traction must be removed
by the application of an equal and opposite
traction the results of which, as derived from
an isothermal analysis, must be superimposed
on the thermal stress analysis. If a surface
traction is prescribed over this and the other
surfaces a further isothermal analysis of the

These equations are exactly of the same form
as the same relations 25.4, 25.5, 25.6 in the
plane stress problem. In fact the two equation
sets are now identical except for the change
in the elastic constants as given above. Thus
the mathematical problem is identically the
same and consequently the discussion of section
A25.4 pertaining to the mathematical formulation
is directly applicable to this plane strain
problem so long as the reader changes the
elastic constants E, Y and _a_ to E 1, Y 1 and _a_ _1 •_
To avoid any confusion these discussions are
briefly repeated here and the pertinent
equations rewritten.

In this case again only the equilibrium
equations expressed in terms of displacements

If X = Y = 0 (body forces zero) the inverse formulation using the stress function ¢,
as defined in 25.19, is the most profitable
approach requiring only the solution to the

The 2-dimensional formulation of plane
stress and plane strain just presented applies
to the majority of structural systems with
which the engineering stress analyst will have
to deal. There will, however, arise heated

¢, structural shapes in which the stress, strain,

and displacement components will not obviously
be such as to comply with the restrictions imposed by the plane stress and plane strain
idealization. In such cases the general equations of 3-dimensional thermoelasticity must be

25.41 employed. These equations should be simplified

as much as possible by assuming appropriate
stress, strain, and displacement components
either zero or negligible. In all such problems
it is adVisable to investigate the thermal
stress analysis under the assumption of unrestrained and traction free boundary conditions
leaving the evaluation of effects of external

s- loading and boundary displacement restraint to

an isothermal analysis. This approach will be
illustrated in the later chapters where the
thermoelastic analysis of shells of revolution
is discussed.

**CHAPTER** A26

**SELECTED** **PROBLEMS** **IN** **ELASTICITY** **AND** **THERMOELASTICITY**



A26.1 Introduction. The preceding chapter pre
sen~ed the general fonnulation of the twodimensional equations of elasticity and thennoelasticity. This chapter is devoted to the
development of solutions of simple problems in
elasticity and th3nnoelasticity employing these
equations rather than the Strength of Materials
approach which will be discussed in the chapter
on bea~s. These problems h~ve been selected
to illustrate clearly the fonnulation of the
governing equations for the chosen mathematical
model, the sO~ltion of these equations and the
interpretation of the results. A large store
of such problems exist in the literature,
especially in the case of the isothermll
analysis, which is referenced at the close of
this chaptero Consequently the problems chosen
for this cl1apter are to illustrate the technique
only and, while they may appear trivial to
some readers, they are intended to provide a
reasonably sound knowledge of the tec~niques
so that the literature can be read easily and
with confidence. In all of the problems of
this chapter the basic assumntions of Chapter
A24 are observed and consequently the discussion is restricted to elastic materials
whose properties are not affected by temperature.


The chapter opens with a selection of
simple one-dimensional problems which are interjected at this point merely to provide the
student with an understanding of the behaviour
of metals when they are heated and the elastic
constants are not affected by the temperature
rise. This section is then followed by a
selection of problems in which th3 fonnulations
of the preceding chapter are employed.


A26.2 One-Dimensional Problems.


&"'{ample 1.
Consider a cylindrical bar of metal
mounted between two rigid walls as shown in
Figure A26.1.


L


Fig. A26.1


The geometrical properties of the bar at the



initial temperature, To, are completely prescribed by the cross-sectional area A and the
length L. The only restraint is that imposed
on the length L by the rigid walls. The
problem is to determine the stress distribution
throughout the bar and the change in shape when
temperature is increased to T.


Assume the bar is unrestrained during the
heating. The change in length will be


l\L a(T     - To)L


or, the new heated total length will be

L~ = L [! + arT - To)]


T To '= Temperature change


where a = Coefficient of linear thennal
expansion


= Change in length per unit length
(at a chosen reference temperature level) per degree change in
temperature.


In engineering it is common practice to
measure temperature chan~e in OF and to use the
reference temperature as 32 [0] F. So long as _a_ is
a constant the reference temperature could be
as well chosen as the original temperature
since, by the definition above, the value of _a_
would be the same. However, for most materials,
_a_ is a coefficient of the temperature and therefore the values given in the following table are

range. Furthermore, every alloy of the
materials shown possess a characteristic Q.
The table can, therefore, be used only as a
guide to the appropriate values of Q and the
exact value obtained from a more extensive

source.


Now, for the exa~ple under discussion, it
can be seen that the bar will have to be compressed an amou~t 6L to fit between the rigid
walls. This will give rise to a compressive
strain of 6L/L, or


£ = - a(T - To) in the axial direction,
and a compressive stress of


_a_ = - Ea(T - To)


Thermal expansion in the radial direction
as well as an elastic strain due to Poisson's
effect will also occur. However there will be
no stresses in the radial direction since
there are no restraints or expansion in this
direction and no surface tractions are applied.
Thus there will exist the compressive stress
uniformly distributed over the cross-section
throughout the length of the bar, if, and only
if, no restraints on the radial deformations
exist at the ends against the walls. The
total load reacting against the wall will be


where A~ is the area of the final cross-section
shape and thus the change in this cross-section
could be significant in the calculation of P if
the material possessed a large value for a and
the temperature rise was large. The Poisson
effect is usually negligible. It is left as an
exercise for the student to determine A~ in
Problem 26.1.


Example 2.
Consider the system of two cylindrical
bars supported between rigid, frictionless
walls and heated to temperature T above the

a~bient temperature To when the bars were a
perfect fit between the walls. The system is
shown below in Figure A26.2.



It then follows that


The final position of the interface will
be located at a distance x from the left hand
wall given by the original length of bar I plus
its thermal elongation plus u~, or


L~ (a~L~+a2L2)(T-To)
x = L~ + a~L~ (or - To) - E (h + A~L2)

It is interesting to note that this problem is
essentially not this simple. The analysis re


for each bar. The problem is to determine the
axial stress in each bar and the displacement
of the interface under the assu~ption of no
restraints in the radial direction and no surface tractions.


Again we remove the restraint from one
end. The total expansion will be


and the bars must be co~pressed by a common
force P so that this total displacement is removed.


The stress in bar 1 will be _a_ ~   -   - -P A~

quires the assu~ption that the interface stress
distribution is un1i.orm across the section of
each bar, In the case of bar 1 this will
certainly not be the case, The extension to
the problem whsre this two-dimensional stress
field is taken into account is beyond the
scope of this chapter. It is sufficient to
note that this effect will be negligible in
all cases except where the ratio of A~/ A z is
large and, again, where the value of P is large,


Besides this obvious extension of the
problem the following meaningful studies are
apparent.


(a) The investigation of the stability of
the simple colu~n system and
(b) The investigation of the flow
behavior at very high temperatures
for both or one of the materials.


These significant and difficult aspects of this
seemingly simple problem will be returned to
in later chapters.


Example 3,
The same problem will be analyzed in a
more direct manner Which d00s not require the
technique of considering the system completely
unrestrained to begin with and then detennining
the loads necessary to restore the original,
or defined, shape. \~h1le this st"lted technique
has been discussed in Chapters A24.4 and A24.5
as being the most desirable, the direct
approach is sometimes the more rational and,
therefore, must not be overlooked, This
problem serves as a good comparative example
at this st"lge in the development of the theory
of thennoelastic ity.


Consider the Figure A26.3 which is the

Example **4.**
A direct application of the preceding
examples is the determination of shear and
tensile stresses developed in bolts of a bolted
connection. Consider the bolted connection
between tVIQ dissimilar metals which are heated
to different temperatures T~ and Ta above
ambient temperature To. Initial bolt clearances are normally allowed in bolted connections
to relieve thermal stresses and such clearances are shovm in Figure A26.4 as C~ and Ca'

directly that

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-538-0.png)


In this chosen case, P will produce compression
in the bar 1 and tension in bar 2 since the expansion of bar 1 was initially greater than that
of bar 2 and it was assumed that this relative
expansion was greater than the total clearance,
whiCh, of course, is necessary for the creation
of thermal stresses at all. The solution should
be generalized to

and the appropriate signs chosen from an initial
estimate of the relative displacements. It is
an interesting extension of this problem to
take into account the elastic deformation of
the bolt in an array of bolts.


The tension load on the bolt, additive to
any bolt prestress, can be deduced in the
follOl'Ving way. The total expansion in the
bars in the bolt axis direction will be (due
to thennal expansion) in each sheet.


There will be an elastic contraction however,

The extension of this last formlla to multiple
layers, bolts of varyinG diameters wherein the
temperature v':lries along the length, etc., is
obvious from th,s above development and the
discussion in example 3 as it applies to
varying temperat'ure along ths bolt axis.


Exdm)le 5.
It is becoming relatively co@non practice
to design primary structures to avoid thermal
stresses. One obvious way of doing so is to
replace the usual flanged wing beam with a
statically determinant truss for no thermal
stresses can exist in such structures so long
as no restraints are imposed on the thermal
expansion of ths whole truss system.


The use of corrugated webs is one example
of a structural technique designod to relieve
thsrmal stresses. In such structures, however,
the thsrmal strains and hence, deflections,
become large and must be considered.


Redundant structures will contain thermal
stresses whenever non-uniform heating is
present even though there are no geometrical
restraints imposed. In the case of statically
indeterminant trusses or space frames wherein
individual members are at different temperatures the analysis is the same as for the
isothermal problem wherein the readily computed thennal strains and deflections are
introduced as initial deformations. This
problem is discussed in detail in article A8.9
of Chapter A8 and consequently is not treated
hsre.


Attention will be now directed to continuous structures such as plates and beams,
wherein the two-dimensional fonnulations of
Chapter A25 will be required.


A26.3 Two-dimensional Problems.


Example 1.
As the first exa~ple let us consider the
problem of the simple beam subjected to an
externally applied moment and with the whole
system at room temperature. The physical
system is as shown beloN in Figure _A26.5._


The problem is to determine the stress,
strain and displacement distribution throughout
the beam under the influence of the positive
end moments shown. The mathematical model is

the same geometrically as that shown in the
Figure _A26.5_ but with the following assumptions:


(1) There are no displacements out of the
x-y plane, i.e., w : O.


(2) All deformations are small so that the
equations of the basic fonnulation
apply.


(3) Since the beam is thin (t is small),
the applied moment lies in the plane
x-y, and there are no surface forces
on the sides of the beam, thus there
exists no stress components in the
z-direction.


(4) There are no body forces present, i.e.
X = Y = Z : O.


From assumption (3) it is obvious that all
stresses lie in the plane x-y and the problem
is therefore one of plane stress. (It so
happens that under assu~ption (2), which is
applied merely as a convenience at this time,
the problem is also one of plane strain.)


The question now is to determine stress
functions for ox' 0y and Txy which will satisfy
the equation of eqUIlibrium, compatability and
the boundary conditions. The basic equations

are: 

equilibrium

ao y + aTxy = 0

compatability



and the boundary conditions

(applied end thrust is zero)

From assumption (3)

an,1 thus


fZ = _tf_ xz = _-I_ yz = °


Since the external loading is bending only
and there is no variation of same in the
x-direction, it is reasonable to assume the
strain distribution to be of the following
form:


f X = Co + C],y (plane sections
remain plane)
f y = f (y)


and thus


Oy   - E f(y)


From the first equilibriun equation it then
follows that ~xy must be a constant or a
function of x only. Then, from the second
equilibriQm equation


or E df(y) = 0, a constant or a function of x.
dy


Due to the symmetry of loading the last
possibility does not exist, the second possibility allows f(y) to be linear function of y
and the third allows f(y) to be a constant.
Neither of these are possible since there are
no normal forces along the top and bottom
edges to balance a Oy component. The only
solution for f(y), and therefore for Oy, which
will satisfy the equilibrium equations is
therefore


f(y) = Oy = 0
E

Thus we have two possible stress components


~xy = f(x)


The first equation of equilibrium is satisfied
but, from the second and the discussion on



°
~xy =


(This could have been assumed directly, of
course, since there is no externally applied
shear present, but the matter of zero internal
shear has been belabored since many students
appear to have some difficulty in grasping this
simple fact.)


Thus the only stress component present is
Ox and the equations of equilibrium are satisfied. It is obvious also that since


~ Ox
f y         -         - E

Ixy=o,


the equation of compatability is also satisfied.
Thus we have the unique general solution to the
mathematical model chosen.


0y = ~xy = ~xz = ~yz = 0z = 0.


It now remains to obtain the specific
solution which satisfies the boundary conditions.
By direct substitution into the boundary condition equations, the constants Co and C], are
readily evaluated. as


Co = [0]

We will again assume that the strain distribution is of the following form


EX = (Co + C~y)g(x)


Ey = fey)


EZ = 0


The assumption for EX is more meaningful
in this case for it limits the discussion to
beams such that the bending action is predominant. This means that the solution
developed under this assumption applies only
to beams where L» d. Let us consider one
station, i.e., one value of x, along the beam
and consider first the boundary condition

The strain distribution follows directly



Now, since there must be zero shear on

x =- 2 it follows directly that f(x) is a

These strain components obviously satisfy
the cOffi)atability eq~ations.


The displacement distribution can be
obtained from the strain-displacement relations
as follows:


Since EX   -   - au ax   - - - EI P (L   - x)y


it follows that u = _P~rx + ~:! + f(y)



It is interesting to note that this
solution differs from that developed from the

it follows that v = k(x) + EI peL - x) -z

Since u = 0 at x = 0 it follows directly
that f(y) = O. From the third straindisplacement relation, viz:


it follows, by direct substitution, that


P (d" 2) = PLx + px" + av
2IG ""4    - Y EI 2EI ax


We are interested in the deflection of the
neutral axis only, that is the plot of
v (x, Y = 0) and therefore we can rewrite this
equation as


dV Pd" PLx Px"
-=--+---dx BIG EI 2EI


Consequently we are imposing the boundary

condition that at x = 0, dx = O.


Upon integration and satisfaction of the
boundary condition v = 0 at x = 0, the general
expression for the deformation of the neutral
axis will be obtained as:

_ Pxd" Px [3] PLx"
v = BIG    - 6EI + 2EI


and the deflection at the tip will be


    - PL 3 PLd"
vx=L = 3EI + BD



The fixed end is not free to distort and
thus allaN the displacement distrlbution
obtained above and therefore the stress and

strain distribution will not be that obtained
in the vicinity of this fixed end. The _solu-_
tion will be valid throughout the beam for all
points x - d (Saint-Venant's Principle). It
should be mentioned also that for the solution
to be valid in the neighborhood of the free
end the shear load P must be applied according
to the shear distribution


P d"
    - (-     - y")
21 4


If this is not done then the solution will
not apply in the region of the free end.


This matter of the fixed end boundary
conditions deserves more study and is therefore
discussed in the next exa~ple. For an even

more eXhaustive discussion the reader is
referred to Reference 1.

Therefore, from Hooke's Law and assuming P d [2] ypy2

EX = - ~ (L - x)y

By direct integration it then follows that

g x () = 8IG 2EI - 6EI - CJ.X + C [3]



_j(_ _ P d [2]

iJ xy - 2IG (4      - y2)


Thus, the complete expressions for u and v
ani then, from the strain-displacement relations will be



u = - _P_ _il_ (L    - ~) + f (y)


v = ~ (L   - X)y2 + g(x)
2EI


where f(y) and g(x) are functions respectively
of y and x alone. It is the aim in this
example to evaluate these functions in a more
general sense than was done in Example 2.
Substitution of the expressions for u and v
in the third strain-displacement relation, viz:


gives

2IG (""4 - y2) = - E~ (L -1) + f' (y)

Now to fix the beam at the end x = 0 it is
necessary to prevent a translation in the u and
v directions and to prevent rotation at this
end. Thus the end conditions can be written as


u(o,o) = v(o,o) = 0



and

This equation must hold for all values of
x and y and we can therefore investigate the
nature of the functions f' (y) and g' (x) by
alternately letting x and y be zero. For
y = 0,

-- Pd [2]  - - 2. P (L -~) + f' (0) + g' (x)

There is a choice on these last two since
we need only 3 boundary conditions in addition
to the equation


to evaluate CJ., C2, C3 and **C** **4 •** Thus the boundary conditions are over prescribed and different
solutions for the displacement distribution can
be obtained by choosing different sets of three.
The choice is only two, however, since no
translation is allowed. The solution for the
set containing the condition


au I = 0
ayx=o, y=O


is that of example 2. Therefore, let us consider
the set containing the condition


av I = 0
axx=o, y=o


Applying these conditions and using the
other available equation in CJ. and C2 provides

Example 4.

Let us now consider the same beam with an
externally applied distributed load as shown
in Figure 26.7.



~xy   - _ w (L 2EI   - x) [d ""4 ~~[2]~~   - y 2]


and the displacements are determined as before.


The actual problem is not as simple however as for the above solution where the upper
and lower edges of the beam are considered
stress free. The applied load as shown will
require that Oy be now-zero on one, or both,
of these faces. In fact, all three stress
components ox' 0y and ~xy will be now-zero
throughout the beam. The solution is not
simple but the reader has now the techniques
to attack it. The solution follows the same
steps as before with careful observation of
the boundary conditions along the top and
bottom edges where 0y is now-zero on the loaded
edge. The most simple example of this problem
is where w is constant along the beam. It is
left as an exercise for the reader to show
that for this case and where the constant load
is hung on the bottom surface giving rise to
the boundary condition

that the stress components are:



It is common engineering practice to
ignore the local effects in the stress field
due to the applied load and to thus retain
the argument that cry = 0 for all values of y.
The only non-zero stress components are thus
Ox and ~xy. The solution technique is therefore the same as in the preceding example but

The solution follows directly the steps of the
preceding example. In the majority of problems
the variation of w along the beam is linear,
lumped into a sequence of discrete loads, or w
is a constant. In any of these cases this
integral is readily evaluated in the initial
steps of the problem solution. For example,
if w = constant,

General Note: Since we are dealing with linear
problems, it is possible to break down any
loading given into components matching those of
the problems given above and by direct superposition of the separate solutions corresponding
to these component loadings obtain the final
solution for the complex combined loading states.
This general technique will be employed to
obtain solutions to general thermoelastic
problems in beams.


EX8.t'llple 5.
Consider the cantilever beam shown subjected to a non-linear temperature distribution
in the depth direction but constant in the
spanwise direction, T = T(y). This general
distribution is an approximation to the


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-545-full.png)

temperature distribution in high speed aircraft
wings.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-545-1.png)

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-545-2.png)


Assumptions: (i) The assumptions governing the
basic theory as discussed in
Chapter A25.
(ii) Oy = ~xy = Oy O.
(iii) The restraint to deformation
v at the root (x = 0) is
negligible. This assumption
is questionable when the root
fixing is considered. The
effect of the inclusion of
root restraint on v can be
evaluated by superposing a
self-equilibrating isothermal
stress pattern to restrain v.
The effect will only be
appreciable in an area local
to the root of a beam (L» d)
and therefore will be
neglected.
(iv) Material properties are
independent of temperature.


Basic equations: (Refer again to Chapter A25.)
Since there are no boundary tractions along the
edges and it is assumed that there is no
resistance to expansion at the root station, it
follows that ~xy = O. It is also now apparent
that Ox will be a function of y only (ox
constant in the spanwise direction) for this
case of thermal loading only.


The compatibility equation (See eq. 25.12),
thus reduces to


Since Ox and T are functions of y only, this
equation further reduces to the ordinary
differential equation


Boundary Conditions.
The cantilever beam is replaced by a beam
of length 2L to satisfy the condition imposed
by symmetry of zero deformation in the
x-direction at the root. On this beam all
surfaces must be zero. Hence the boundary
conditions on Ox can be written as;


(1) The reSUltant force over the end
face at x + L is zero or

(ii) The resultant moment on these faces
must be zero or

The general solution is obtained by direct

Ox = - aET + C ~ Y + C 2

the strain displacement relations that

no stresses will result. Strains, however, will

It should be noted that the boundary
condition of zero normal stresses at the
boundary x = ! L is not satisfied. The solution
obtained is valid only over the range x =

If the solution is to be extended over the
range - L - x - L then a self-equilibrating
stress-distribution must be applied at the ends
to balance the normal stresses. This is a
difficult problem and beyond the scope of this
discussion.

Concluding Remarks.


The examples given above illustrate how
problems in two-dimensional elasticity are
attacked and how problems involving complex
loading states can be simplified by consideration of separate more simple components of the
loading state and obtaining the final solution
by employing superposition. This technique is
further illustrated in those problems dealing
with thermal stresses.


It should be borne in mind that the
simplification of the general three-dimensional
elasticity problem to the two-dimensional planestress or plane-strain problem must be done with
care and the consequences of this idealization,
as it is in the majority of problems, not overlooked.

All of the illustrative problems presented
in this chapter are almost mathematically

trivial problems in the theory of elasticity
and thermoelasticity. We have restricted our
attention to simple beam problems where the

bea~ depth is small compared to the length and
where the temperature varies across the depth
only. However, the basic equations and
solution techniques are basic to the solution
of more complex problems where the temperature
is a function of two spatial coordinates,
T = T(x,y), and the geometry is that of a
general two dimentional plate. In these
problems all the stress components will exist
and displacements in the z-direction may occur
in the general two-dimensional plate problem.
Generalization of the teclLniques illustrated
here in this class of problems is beyond the
scope of this discussion and the r~ader who
wishes to pursue this sUbject is referred to
references listed in next column which can now
be read with ease.


An important assumption basic to all of
the preceding discussion on thermoelasticity
and inherent in the references cited is that
there exists no "thermo-mec11anical coupling".
This allows the calculation of the temperature
field as a separate problem with no crosscoupling with the mechanical response (without



the inclusion of the kinematical variables) and
that the elasticity problem due to this
temperature distribution can be considered
separately. This assumption is valid only if
the rate processes involved are slow.

**PART B**

**FLIGHT** **VEHICLE** **MATERIALS** **AND** **THEIR PROPERTIES**


**CHAPTER** **Bl**

**BASIC** **PRINCIPLES** **AND** **DEFINITIONS**



Bl. 1 Introduction.


The flight vehicle structures engineer
faces a major design requirement of a high
degree of structural integrity against failure,
but with as light structural weight as possible.
structural failure in flight vehicles can
often prove serious relative to loss of life
and the vehicle. However, experience has
shown that if a flight vehicle, whether
military or commercial in type, is to be
satisfactory from a payload and performance
standpoint, major effort must be made to save
structural weight, that is, to eliminate all
structural weight not required to insure
against failure.


Since a flight vehicle is sUbjected to
various types of loading such as static,
dynamic and repeated, which may act under a
wide range of temperature conditions, it is
necessary that the structures engineer have a
broad knowledge of the behavior of materials
under loading if safe and efficient structures
are to be obtained. This Part B provides
information for the structures design engineer
relative to the behavior of the most common
flight vehicle materials under load and the
various other conditions encountered in flight
environment, such as elevated temperatures.


Bl. 2 Failure of Structures.



Failure in a different manner can result
from a structural unit being too fleXible, and
this fleXibility might influence aerodynamic
forces sufficiently as to produce unsatisfactory vehicle flying characteristics. In some
cases this flexibility may not be serious
relative to the loss of the vehicle, but it is
still a degree of failure because changes must
be made in the structure to provide a satisfactory operating vehicle. In some cases,
excessive distortion such as the torsional
tWist of the wing can be very serious as this
excessive deflection can lead to a build-up
of aerodynamic-dynamic forces to cause flutter
or violent vibration which can cause failure
involving the loss of the airplane.


To illustrate another degree of failure
of a structural unit, consider a wing bUilt in
fuel tank. The stiffened sheet units which
make up the tank are also a part of the wing
structure. In general these sheet units are
designed not to wrinkle or buckle under airplane operating conditions in order to insure
against leakage of fuel around riveted connections. Therefore if portions of the tank
walls do wrinkle in operation resulting in
fuel leakage, which in turn require repair or
modification of the structure, we can say
failure has occurred since the tank failed to
do its job satisfactory, and involves the item
of extra expense to make satisfactory. To
illustrate further, the flight vehicle is
equipped with many installations, such as the
control systems for the control surfaces, the
power plant control system etc., which involves
many structural units. In many cases excessive elastic or inelastic deformation of a
unit can cause unsatisfactory operation of
the system, hence the unit can be considered
as having failed although it may not be a
serious failure relative to causing the loss
of the vehicle. Thus the aero-astro
structures engineer is concerned with and
responsible for preventing many degrees of
failure of structural units which make up the
flight vehicle and its installations and
obviously the greater his knowledge regarding
the behavior of materials, the greater his
chances of avoiding troubles from the many
degrees of structural failure.


Bl. 3 General Types of Loading.



A flight vehicle like any other machine,
is designed to do a certain job satisfactorily.
If any structural unit of the vehicle suffers
effects which in turn effects in some manner
the satisfactory performance of the vehicle,
the unit can be considered as having failed.
Failure of a structural unit is therefore a
rather broad term. For example, failure of a
structural unit may be due to too high a stress
or load causing a complete fracture of the unit
while the vehicle is in flight. If this unit
should happen to be one such as a wing beam or
a major wing fitting, the failure is a serious
one as it usually involves loss of the airplane
and loss of life. Likewise the collapse of a
strut in landing gear structure during a landing operation of the airplane can be a very
serious failure. Failure of a structural unit
may be due to fatigue and since fatigue failure
is of the fracture type Without warning indications of impending failure, it can also prove
to be a very serious type of failure.



Failure of a structural member is in~
fluenced by the manner in which the load is

Bl.l

B1.2 BEHAVIOR OF MATERIALS AND THEIR PROPERTIES



applied. Relative to the length of time in
applying the load to a member, two broad
classifications appear logical, namely,
(1) Static loading and (2) Dynamic loading.
For purposes of explanation and general
discussion, these two broad classifications
will be further broken down as follows:

Continuous Loading.
Gradually or slowly applied
Static Loading loading.

{ Repeated gradually applied

loading.


Impact or rapidly applied
Dynamic Loading loading.

{ Repeated impact loading.


Static Continuous Loading. A continuous load
is a load that remains on the member for a long
period of time. The most common example is the
dead weight of the member or the structure itself. When an airplane becomes airborne, the
weight of the wing and its contents is a continuous load on the wing. A tank subjected to
an internal pressure for a considerable period
of time is a continuous load. Since a continuous load is applied for a long time, it is a
type of loading that provides favorable conditions for creep, a term to be explained later.
For airplanes, continuous loadings are usually
associated with other loads acting simultaneously.


Static Gradually or Slowly Applied Loads. A
static gradually applied load is one that
slowly builds up or increases to its maximum
value without causing appreciable shock or
vibration. The time of loading may be a
matter of seconds or even hours. The stresses
in the member increases as the load is increased and remains constant when the load
becomes constant. As an example, an airplane
which is climbing with a pressurized fuselage,
the internal pressure loading on the fuselage
structure is gradually increasing as the
difference in air pressure between the inside
and outside of the fuselage gradually increases
as the airplane climbs to higher altitudes.


Static Repeated Gradually Applied Loads. If a
gradually applied load is applied a large number of times to a member it is referred to as a
repeated load. The load may be of such nature
as to repeat a cycle causing the stress in the
member to go to a maximum value and then back
to zero stress, or from a maximum tensile
stress to a maximum compressive stress, etc.
The situation envolving repeated loading is
important because it can cause failure under
a stress in a member which would be perfectly
safe, if the load was applied only once or a
small number of times. Repeated loads usually
cause failure by fracturing Without warning,



thus repeated loads are important in design of
structures.


Dynamic or Impact Loading. A dynamic or impact
loading when applied to a member produces
appreciable shock or vibration. To produce
such action, the load must be applied far more
rapid than in a static loading. This rapid
application of the load causes the stresses
in the member to be momentarily greater than
if the same magnitUde of load was applied
statically, that is slowly applied. For
example, if a weight of magnitUde W is
gradually placed on the end of a cantilever
beam, the beam will bend and gradually reach
a maximum end deflection. However if this
same weight of magnitude W is dropped on the
end of the beam from even such a small height
as one foot, the maximum end deflection will
be several times that under the same static
load W. The beam will Vibrate and finally
come to rest with the same end deflection as
under the static load W. In bringing the
dynamic load to rest, the beam must absorb
energy equal to the change in potential energy
of the falling load W, and thus dynamic loads
are often referred to as energy loads.


From the basic laws of Physics, force
equals mass times acceleration (F = Ma) and
acceleration equals time rate of change of
velocity. Thus if the velocity of a body
such as an airplane or missile is changed in
magnitude, or the direction of the velocity
of the vehicle is changed, the vehicle is
accelerated which means forces are applied to
the vehicle. In severe flight airplane
maneuvers like pulling out of a dive from
high speeds or in striking a severe transverse air gust when flying at high speed, or
in landing the airplane on ground or water,
the forces acting externally on the airplane
are applied rather rapidly and are classed
as dynamic loads. Chapter A4 discusses the
subject of airplane loads relative to Whether
they can be classed as static or dynamic and
how they are treated relative to design of
aircraft structures.


Bl. 4 The Static Tension Stress-Strain Diagram.


The information for plotting a tension
stress-strain diagram of a material is obtained by loading a test specimen in axial
tension and measuring the load With corresponding elongation over a given length, as
the specimen is loaded statically (gradually
applied) from zero to the failing load. To
standardize results standard size test
specimens are specified by the (ASTM) American
society For Testing Materials. The speed of
the testing machine cross-head should not
exceed 1/16 inch per inch of gage length per
minute up to the yield point of the material


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-551-full.png)

and it should not exceed _1/2_ inch per inch of
gage length per minute from the yield point to
the rupturing point of the material. The
instrument for measuring the elongation must
be calibrated to read 0.0002 inches or less.
The information given by the tension stressstrain diagram is needed by the engineer since
it is needed in strength design, rigidity
design, energy absorption, quality control and
many other uses.



Fig. Bl.l shows typical tensile stressstrain diagrams of materials that fall in three
broad classifications. In the study of such
diagrams various facts and relationships have
been noted relative to behavior of materials
and standard terms and symbols have been provided for this basic important information.
These terms will be explained briefly.

Modulus of Elasticity (E). The mechanical t.l
property that defines resistance of a material
in the elastic range is called stiffness and
for ductile materials is measured by the value
termed Modulus of Elasticity, and, designated
by the capital letter E. Referring to Fig.

three diagrams is a straight line, which indicates a constant ratio between stress and ~

The clad aluminum alloys have two E values
as indicated in the lower diagram of Fig. Bl.l.
The initial modulus is the same as for other
aluminum alloys, but holds only up to the proportional limit stress of the soft pure
aluminum coating material. Immediately above
this point there is a short transition stage
and the material then exhibits a secondary
modulus of Elasticity up to the proportional
limit stress of the stronger core material.
This second modulus is the slope of the second
straight line in the diagram. Both modulus
values are based on a stress using the gross
area which includes both core and covering
material.


Tensile Proportional Limit Stress. (Ftb). The
proportional limit stress is that stress which
exists when the stress strain curve departs
from the initial straight line portion by a
unit strain of 0.0001. In general the proportional limit stress gives a practical
diViding line between the elastic and inelastic
range of the material. The modulus of
elasticity is considered constant up to the



proportional limit stress.


Tensile Yield Stress (Fty). In referring
to the upper diagram in Fig. Bl.l, we find
that some materials show a sharp break at a
stress considerably below the ultimate stress
and that the material elongates considerably
with little or no increase in load. The
stress at which this takes place is called
the yield point or yield stress. However many
materials and most flight vehicle materials do
not show this sharp break, but yield more
gradually as illustrated in the middle diagram
of Fig. Bl.l, and thus there is no definite
yield point as described above. Since
permanent deformations of any appreciable
amount are undesirable in most structures or
machines, it is normal practice to adopt an
arbitrary amount of permanent strain that is
considered admissible for design purposes.
Test authorities have established this value
of permanent strain or set as 0.002 and the
stress which existed to cause this permanent
strain when released from the material 1s
called the yield stress. Fig. Bl.l shows how

it is determined graphically by drawing a line
from the 0.002 point parallel to the straight
portion of the stress-strain curve, and where
this line intersects the stress-strain curve
represents the yield strength or yield stress.



Figs. Bl.3 and Bl.4 compare the shapes of
the tension stress-strain curves for some
common aircraft materials.


B1. 5 The Static Compression Stress-Strain Diagram.



Ultimate Tensile Stress (Ftu). The ultimate
tensile stress is that stress under the maximum load carried by the test specimen. It
should be realized that the stresses are based
on the original cross-sectional area of the
test specimen without regard to the lateral
contraction of the specimen during the test,
thus the actual or true stresses are greater
than those plotted in the conventional stressstrain curve. Fig. Bl.2 shows the general
relationship between actual and the apparent
stress as plotted in stress-strain curves.
The difference is not appreciable until the
higher regions of the plastic range are
reached.

Fig. B1. 4 Stress-Strain Curves. Initial Portions.



Fig. 81.5 shows a comparison of the
stress-strain curves in tension and compression for four Widely used aluminum alloys.
Below the proportional limit stress the
modulus of elasticity is the same under both
tension and compressive stresses. The yield
stress in compression is determined in the
same manner as explained for tension.


Compressive Ultimate Stress (F cu )' Under a
static tension stress, the ultimate tensile
stress of a member made from a given material
is not influenced appreciably by the shape of
the cross-section or the length of the member,
however under a compressive stress the
ultimate compressive strength of a member is
greatly influenced by both cross-sectional
shape and length of the member. Any member,
unless very short and compact, tends to
buckle laterally as a whole or to buckle
laterally or cripple locally when under
compressive stress. If a member is quite
short or restrained against lateral buckling,
then failure for some materials such as stone,
wood and a few metals will be by definite
fracture, thus giving a definite value for
the Ultimate compressive stress. Most aircraft materials are so· ductile that no fracture
is encountered in compression, but the material
yields and swells out so that the increasing
cross-sectional area tends to carry increasing
load. It is therefore practically impossible
to select a value of the ultimate compressive
stress of d uctlle materials without having

The slope of this tangent gives the local rate
of change of stress With strain. The secant
modulus Es is determined by drawing a secant
(straight line) from the origin to the point
in question. This modulus measures the ratio
between stress and actual strain. Curves
which show how the tangent modulus varies
With stress are referred to as tangent modulus
curves. Fig. Bl.5 illustrates such curves
for four different aluminum alloys. It should
be noted that the tangent modulus is the same
as the modulus of elasticity in the elastic
range and gets smaller in magnitude as the
stress gets higher in the plastic range.


Bl. 7 Elastic - Inelastic Action.


If a member is SUbjected to a certain
stress, the member undergoes a certain strain.
If this strain vanishes upon the removal of
the stress, the action is called elastic.
Generally speaking, for practical purposes,



12 a material is considered elastic under stresses
up to the proportional limit stress as
previously defined. Fig. Bl.7 illustrates
elastic action. However, if when the stress
is removed, a residual strain remains, the
action is generally referred to as inelastic
or plastic. Fig. Bl.8 illustrates inelastic
action.

some arbitrary measure or criteron. For
wrought materials it is normally assumed that
Fcu equals Ftu' For brittle materials, that
are relatively weak in tension, an Fcu higher
than Ftu can be obtained by compressive tests
of short compact specimens and this ultimate
compressive stress is generally referred to
as the block compressive stress.

Modern structural theory for calculating
the compressive strength of structural members
as covered in detail in other chapters of this
book, makes use of two additional terms or
values which measure the stiffness of a member
when the compressive stresses in the member
fall in the inelastic range. These terms are
tangent modulus of elasticity (Et) and secant
,modulus of elasticity (E s )' These two modifications of the modulus of elasticity (E)
apply in the plastic range and are illustrated
in Fig. Bl.6. The tangent modulus Et is
determined by drawing a tangent to the stressstrain diagram at the point under consideration.

81.8 Ductility.



The term ductility from an engineering
standpoint indicates a large capacity of a
material for inelastic (plastic) deformation
in tension or shear without rupture, as
contrasted with the term brittleness which
indicates little capacity for plastic deformation without failure. From a physical
standpoint, ductility is a term which measures


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-554-full.png)

**B1. 6** **BEHAVIOR** **OF** **MATERIALS** **AND** **THEIR** **PROPERTIES**



the ability of a material to be drawn into a
wire or tube or to be forged or die cast.
Ductility is usually measured by the percentage
elongation of a tensile test specimen after
failure, for a specified gage length, and is
usually an accurate enough value to compare
materials.


Percent elongation = (La **L-** 0 L 0) 100 = measure of
ductility.


where L o = original gage length and La = gage
length after fracture. In referring to
ductility in terms of percent alongation, it
is important that the gage length be stated,
since the percent elongation will vary with
gage length, because a large part of the total
strain occurs in the necked down portion of the
gage length just before fracture.


**B1. 9 Capacity to Absorb Energy.** **Resilience.** **Toughness.**


Resilience. The capacity of a material to
absorb energy in the elastic range is referred
to as its resilience. For measure of
resilience we have the term modulus of
resilience, which is defined as the maximum
amount of energy per unit volume which can be
stored in the material by stressing it and
then completely recovered when the stress is
removed. The maximum stress for elastic
action for computing the modulus of resilience
is usually taken as the proportional limit
stress. Therefore for a unit volume of
material (1 cu. in.) the work done in stressing
a material up to its proportional limit stress
would equal the avera~e stress _f_ _p_ _/2_ times the
elongation (E p) in one inch. If we let U
represent modulus of resilience, then


U = (: p) E p --------------- (1)


But Ep = _fplE,_ hence

U = (f;) (f~) - _fp2/2E_ (2)


Under a condition of axial loading, the modulus
of resilience can be found as the area under
the stress-strain curve up to the proportional
limit stress. Thus in Fig. Bl.9, the area OAB
represents the energy absorbed in stressing
the material from zero to the proportional
limi t stress.


High resilience is desired in members
subjected to shock, such as springs. From
equation (1), a high value of resilience is
obtained when the proportional limit stress is





![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-554-0.png)





high and the strain at this stress is high,
or from equation (2), when the proportional
limit stress is high and modulUS of elasticity
is low.


In Fig. Bl.9 if the stress is released
from point D in the plastic range, the recovery
diagram will be approximately a straight line
DD parallel to AO, and the area CDE represents
the energy released, and often referred to as
hyper-elastic resilience.


Toughness. Toughness of a material can be
defined as its ability to absorb energy when
stressed in the plastic range. Since the
term energy is involved, another definition
would be the capacity of a material for
resisting fracture under a dynamic load.
Toughness is usually measured by the term
modulus of Toughness which is the amount of
strain energy absorbed per unit volume when
stressed to the ultimate strength value.


In Fig. Bl.9, let f equal the average
stress over the unit strain distance dE from
F to G. Then work done per unit volume in
stressing F to G is fdE which is represented
by the area FGHI. The total work done in
stressing to the ultimate stress fu would
then equal _I_ _[Ek]_ fdE, which is the area under

the entire stress-strain curve up to the
ultimate stress point, or the area 0 A J K 0
in Fig. Bl.9 and the units are in. lb. per
cu. inch. Strictly speaking it should not
include the elastic resilience or the energy
absorbed in the elastic range, but since this
area is small compared to the area under the
curve in the plastic range it is usually
included in toughness measurements.


It should be noted that the capacity of
a member for resisting an aXially applied
dynamic load is increased by increasing the
length of a member, because the volume is
increased directly With length. However, the
Ultimate strength remains the same since it
is a function of cross-sectional area and not
of volume of the material.


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-555-full.png)

Toughness is a desirable characteristic
when designing to resist impact or dynamic
loads as it gives a reserve strength or factor
of safety against failure by fracture when
over-loading in actual use should haDpen to
cause the member to be stressed fairly high
into the plastic zone.


The property of ductility helps to produce
toughness, but does not alone control toughness
as illustrated in Fig. Bl.lO, which shows the

stress-strain curves for three different
materials. Material (A) is strong but brittle,
whereas material (C) is weak and ductile, and
material (B) represents average strength and
ductility. However, all three materials have
the same modulus of toughness since the areas
under all three curves is the same.


B1.10 Poisson's Ratio.


When a material is stressed, it will
deform in the direction of the stress and also
at right angles to it. For axial loading and
for stress below the proportional limit stress,
the ratio of the unit strains at right angles
to the stress, to the unit strain in the
direction of the stress is called Poisson's
ratio. It is determined by direct measurement
in a tensile or compressive test of a specimen,
and is approximately equal to 0.3 for steel
and 0.33 for non-ferrous materials. In many
structures there are members which are subjected
to stresses in more than one direction, say
along all three coordinate axes. Poisson's
ratio is used to determine the reSUltant stress
and deformation in the various directions.


Poisson's Ratio in Plastic Range. Information
is somewhat limited as to Poisson's ratio in
the plastic range and particularly during the
transition range from elastic to plastic action.
For the assumption of a plastically
incompressible isotropic SOlid, Poisson's ratio
assumeS a value of 0.5. Gerard and Weldform
found from their research, that the transition
of Poisson's ratio from the elastic value of
around 1/3 to 1/2 in the plastic range is
gradual and is most pronounced in the yield
point region of the stress-strain curve.

B1.11 Construction of a Stress-strain Curve Through a
Given Yield stress by Using a Known Test StressStrain Curve.


Materials in general are produced to
satisfy certain guaranteed minimum strength
properties such as yield stress, ultimate
tensile stress, etc. Thus in the design of
important members in a composite structure,
the minimum guaranteed properties must be used
to provide the required degree of safety. In
general, most materials will give properties
slightly above the guaranteed values, thus
the test stress-strain curve of purchased
material cannot be used for design purposes.
The stress-strain curve passing through a
given yield point stress can be readily obtained for a test stress-strain curve as
follows:


In Fig. Bl.ll, the heavy curve 0 B C
represents a known typical stress-strain curve
for the given material. Let the minimum
guaranteed yield stress be the value as shown
at point A, using the 0.2 percent method.
Then proceed as follows:


(1) Draw a straight line through point 0 and
point A which will intersect the typical
curve at point B. Point B may be above
or below the typical curve.


(2) Locate any other point on the typical
curve such as point C, and draw line
from 0 through C.


(3) Locate point D on line 0 C by the following ratio:

OD = OA x OC
OB

(4) Repeat step 3 to obtain a number of
points as shown by dots on Fig. Bl.ll,
and draw smooth curve through these points
to obtain desired stress-strain curve.

B1. 12 Non-Dimensional stress-strain Curves.


The structural designer is constantly
confronted with the design of structural units
which fail by inelastic instability. The


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-556-full.png)

B1.8 BEHAVIOR OF MATERIALS AND THEIR PROPERTIES



solution of such problems requires information
given by the compressive stress-strain curve.
Since flight vehicles make use of many different materials, and each material usually has
many different states of manufacture which
give different mechanical properties, the
question of time required to obtain certain
design information from stress-strain curves
becomes important. For example, in the
aluminum alloys alone there are about 100
different alloys, and when elevated temperatures
at various time exposures are added, the number
of stress-strain curves required is further
greatly increased.


Fortunately, this time consuming work was
greatly lessened when Ramsberg and Osgood
(Ref. 1) proposed an equation to describe the
stress-strain curve in the yield range. Their
proposed equation specifies the stress-strain
curve by the use of three parameters, the
modulus of elasticity E, the secant yield
stress F o • 7, which is taken as the line of
slope 0.7E drawn from origin (see Fig. Bl.12),
and a parameter n which describes the shape
of the stress-strain curve in the yield region.
In order to evaluate the term n, another stress
F o s& is needed, which is the intersection of
the curve by a line of slope of O.85E through
the origin (see Fig. Bl.12).

The Ramsberg and Osgood proposed three
parameter representation of stress-strain
relations in the inelastic range Is:

                             -                              -                              -                              -                              (3)


The equation for n is,


n = 1 + loge (17/7)/loge(F o • 7 /F o • u ) (4)


Fig. Bl.13 is a plot of equation (4). The
quantities EE/F 0.7 are non-dimensional and may
be used in determining the non-dlmenslonal
curves of Fig. B1.l4. E, n, and F o • 7 must be
known to use these curves in obtaining values



on the stress-strain curve. Table Bl.l gives
the values of F o • 7, F o • s &, n, etc., for many
flight vehicle materials. Notice that the
shape parameter varies Widely for materials,
being as low as 4 and as high as 90.


B1. 13 Influence of Temperature on Material Properties.


Before the advent of the supersonic airplane or the long range missile, the aeronautical structures engineer could design the
airframe of aircraft using the normal static
mechanical properties of materials, since the
temperature rise encountered by such aircraft
had practically no effect on the material
strength properties. The development of the
turbine jet and rocket jet power plants provided the means of opening up the whole new
field of supersonic and space flight. The
flight environmental conditions were now
greatly expanded, the major change being that
aerodynamic heating caused by high speeds in
the atmosphere caused surface temperatures
on the airframe which would greatly effect
the normal static material strength propertIes
and thus temperature and time became important
in the structural desIgn of certain types of
flight vehicles.


B1. 14 Creep of Materials.


It is obvious that temperature can weaken
a material because if the temperature is high
enough the material will melt or flow and thus
have no load carrying capacity as a structural
member. When a stressed member is subjected
to temperature, it undergoes a change of shape
in addition to that of the well known thermal
expansion. The term creep is used to describe
this general influence of temperature and time
on a stressed material. Creep Is defined in
general as the progressive, relatively slow
change in shape under stress when subjected
to an elevated temperature. A simple illustration of creep is a person standing on a
bituminous road surface on a very hot summer
day. The longer he stands on the same spot
the deeper the shoe soles settle into the road
surface, whereas on a cold Winter day the same
time of standing on one spot would produce no
noticeable penetration of the road surface.


High temperature, when used in reference
to creep, has different temperature values for
different materials for the same amount of
creep. For example, mercury, which melts at
-38 [0] F, may creep a certain amount at -750F,
whereas tungsten, which melts at 6l70 [0] r, may
not creep as much at 2000 [0] F as the mercury
under -75OF. All materials creep under
conditions of temperature, stress and time of
stress application. The simplest manner in
whIch to obtain the effects of creep is to
study Its effect on the static stress-strain
diagram for the material.

Bl.12 BEHAVIOR OF MATERIALS AND THEIR PROPERTIES



Fig. Bl.15 (curves A and B) show the
stress-strain curve for a material. Curve (A)
is for a low elevated temperature condition
and curve (B) that of a high elevated
temperature condition. The results were obtained by a normal testing machine procedure
requiring a short time test period, hence the
results can be considered as independent of
time.

INCREASING STRAIN _


Fig. Bl. 15 (Ref. 2) - Effect of temperature and time on the
strength characteristics of metals.


The figure shows that the higher
temperature (curve B) reduces the ultimate
strength, yield strength and modulus of
elasticity of the material as compared to
curve (A) which is a test at a lower temperature.


EFFECT OF TIME


If temperature and stress are of such
combination as to produce appreciable creep,
then time becomes an important effect. For
example, in Fig. Bl.15, if the material at low
temperature (curve A) is stressed to a value P
within the elastic limit of the material, and
this stress is maintained for a considerable
time period, very little creep, if any, will
be detected, and when the stress is removed,
the material will practically resume its
original dimensions. However, if the material
is stressed to the same value P but under a
high temperature condition, creep will occur
just as long as the stress P remains applied
and the stress-strain curve will take a shape
like curve (C) in Fig. Bl.15. This time
dependent strain will follow a characteristic
pattern. The material will never return to
its original shape after creep has taken place
regardless if the stress is removed. If both
stress and high temperature continue, rupture
produced by creep will finally occur.

that increasing stress changes the creep-time

Bl. 15. The General Creep Pattern.


A typical manner of plotting creep-rupture
test data is illustrated in Fig. 81.16. For
metals tested at high value of stress or
temperature, three stages in the creep-time
relation can be observed as shown in Fig. Bl.16.
The initial stage, often called the stage of
primary creep, inclUdes the elastic deformation
and that region where the rate of creep deformation decreases rather rapidly with time,
which no doubt indicates an influence of strain
hardening. The second stage, often referred
to as the secondary creep stage, represents a
stage where the rate of strain has decreased
to a constant value (except for high stress)
for a considerable time period, and this stage
represents the period of minimum creep rate.
The third stage, often called the tertiary
creep stage, represents the period where the
reduction in cross-sectional area leads to a
higher stress, a greater creep rate and finally
rupture.


Transition Point. The inflection point between
the constant creep rate of the second stage and
the increasing rate of the third stage is
referred to as the transition point. Failure
generally occurs in a relatively short time
after the transition point. Transition points
may not occur at very low stresses and may
also not be 'definable at very high stresses.
Minimum creep rate is that indicated in the
second stage, where the creep rate is practically constant.

plants, the critical design factor is not
strength but the permissible amount of creep
that can be allowed to still permit the
structure or machine to function or operate
satisfactorily. Extensive tests are usually
necessary to provide reliable creep design
information and such test information is often
recorded in the form as illustrated in Fig.
Bl.18.

B1. 17 Effect of Time of Exposure.


In general materials can be roughly
classified into those which time of exposure
to elevated temperatures has great influence
on the mechanical properties and those where
such exposure produces relatively small effect.


This general fact is illustrated in Figs.
Bl.19 and Bl.20. The yield strength of the
aluminum alloy in Fig. Bl.19 is far more
influenced by time of exposure to elevated
temperature than the steel alloy as shown in
Fig. Bl.20.

Supersonic aircraft and missiles are
subjected to rapid aerodynamic heating. The
results of tests indicate that in general
metals can withstand substantially higher

Bl. 19 General Effect of Low Temperatures Upon Material
Properties.


The development of the missile and the
space vehicle brought another factor into the
ever increasing number of environmental conditions that effect structural design, namely,
extremely low temperatures. For example, in
space the shady side of the flight vehicle is
subjected to very low temperatures. Missiles
carry fuels and oxidizers such as liquid
hydrogen and oxygen which boil at -423 and
-297 [o] F respectively. In general, low
temperatures increase the strength and stiffness of materials. This effect tends to
decrease the ductility of the material or, in
other words, produce brittleness, a property
that is not desirable in structures because
of the possibility of a catastrophiC failure.
In general, the hexagonal closely packed
crystalline structures are best suited for
giving the best service under low temperatures.
The most important of such materials are
aluminum, titanium, and nickel-base alloys.
Fig. Bl.23 shows the effect of both elevated
and low temperatures on the Ultimate tensile
strength of 20l4-T6 aluminum alloy under
various exposure times.


Bl.20 Fatigue of Materials.


Designing structures to provide safety
against what is called fatigue failure is one
of the most important and difficult problems
facing the structural designer of flight



![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-562-0.png)

Strength (Ftu) of 2014-T 6 Aluminum Alloy.


vehicles. Fatigue failure is failure due to
being stressed a number of times. For example,
a beam may be designed to safely and efficiently carry a design static load and it will carry
this static load indefinitely without failure.
However, if this load is repeated a large
enough number of times, it will fail under this
static design load. The higher the beam stress
under the static design load, the less the
number of repeated loadings to cause failure.


To date no adequate theory has been
developed to clearly explain the fatigue
failure of materials. Fatigue failure appears
to begin with a crack starting at a point of
weakness in the material and progressing along
crystal boundaries. A microscopic examination
of metals indicates there are many small
cracks scattered throughout a material. Under
the action of repeated stress these small
cracks open and close during the stress cycle.
The cracks cause higher stress to exist at
the base of the crack as compared to the
stress if there were no crack. Under this
repeated concentration of stress, the cracks
will gradually extend across the section of
the member and finally causing complete
failure of the member.


Fatigue testing consists of 3 types:(1) the testing of material crystals, (2) the
testing of small structural test specimens,
and (3) the testing of complete composite
structures. A tremendous amount of test
information is available for the second type
of testing. More and more attention is being
given to the third type of testing. For
example, a complete airplane wing or fuselage
is often subjected to elaborate fatigue
testing in order to insure the safe design
life of the airplane.


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-563-full.png)

The presence of cracks initially is not
necessary to start a fatigue or progressive
failure as irregularities such as slag
inclusions, surface scratches, pitting, etc.,
can cause corrosive action to start, thus
supplying the condition for the promotion of
cracks and the resultant progressive failure.


The strength of ferrous metals under
repeated stresses is often referred to as the
endurance or fatigue limit. The endurance
limit stress is the stress that can be repeated
an infinite number of times without causing
fracture of the material. Non-ferrous
materialsjsuch as the aluminum alloys do not
have an endurance limit as defined above but
continue to weaken as the stress cycles are
increased. Due to this fact and also since
the required service life of structures and
machines vary greatly, it is customary to
refer to the strength under repeated stresses
as endurance or fatigue strength instead of
endurance limit. Thus the fatigue strength
is the maximum stress that can be repeated
for a specified number of cycles Without
producing failure of the structural unit.


The results of testing a specimen under
repeated stresses such as tension, compression,
bending, etc., is often plotted in a form
which is referred to as the S-N (stress versus
cycles) diagram, as illustrated in Fig. Bl.24.

magnitude of stresses in aircraft structures is
discussed briefly in Chapter A4. The limited
discussion which follows will deal only With
the effect of impact loads on the behavior of
materials.


IMPACT TESTING METHODS


There are in general two types of tests to
determine the behavior of materials under
impact loads. The usual impact test which has
been conducted for many years is referred to as
the notched bar test and consists of subjecting
notched specimens to axial, bending and torsional
loads by the well known Charpy or Izod impact
testing machines. In both of these machines
an impact load is applied to the specimen by
swinging a weight Wfrom a certain vertical
height (h) to strike and rupture the notched
specimen and then stopping at a vertical
height (h'). The energy expended in rupturing
the specimen is then equal approximately to
(Wh-Wh'). This type of test is primarily used
for studying the influence of metallurgical
variables.


The other type of impact testing is made
on unnotched specimens and the general purpose
is to obtain the stress-strain diagram of
materials under impact load or the loaddistortion diagram of a structural member or
composite structure as the unit is completely
fractured under an impact load.


Bl. 22 Examples of Some Results of Impact Testing
of Materials.


Figs. Bl.25, 26 and 27 show the results
of impact tests upon the stress-strain curve
as compared to the static stress-strain
diagram (Ref. 5).

An impact load when applied to a structure
produces appreciable shock or Vibration. To
produce such action, the load must be applied
rapidly, that is, in a short interval of time.
The effect of impact loads differs from that
of static loads in that impact loads appreciably
effect the magnitude of the stresses produced
in a member and also the resistance properties
or behavior of the material under load. The
importance and effect of dynamic loads on the

**MECHANICAL** **AND** **PHYSICAL PROPERTIES** **OF** **METALLIC**

**MATERIALS FOR FLIGHT** **VEHICLE** **STRUCTURES**


General Explanation. It would require several hundred pages to list the properties of the many
materials used in flight vehicle structural design. The metallic materials presented in this
chapter are those most widely used and should be sUfficient for the use of the student in his
structural analysis and design problems. All Tables and Charts in this chapter are taken from
the government publication "Military Handbook, MIL-HDBK-5, August, 1962. Metallic Materials and
Elements for Flight Vehicle Structures". This publication is for sale by the Supt. of Public

Doc~~ents, Washington 25, D.C. The properties given in the various tables are for a static
loading condition under room temperature. The effect of temperature upon the mechanical
properties is given in the various graphs.

DESIGN OF STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS


CHAPTER Cl

COMBINED STRESSES. THEORY OF YIELD AND ULTIMATE FAILURE.



Cl. I Uniform Stress Condition


Aircraft structures are subjected to many
types of external loadings. These loads often
cause axial, bending and shearing stresses
acting simultaneously. If structures are to be
designed satisfactorily, combined stress relationships must be known. Although in practical structures uniform stress distribution is
not common, still sufficient accuracy for
design practice is provided by using the stress
relationships based on uniform stress assumptions. In deriving these stress relationships,
the Greek letter sigma (0) will represent a
stress intensity normal to the surface and thus
a tensile or compressive stress and the Greek
letter tau (~) will represent a stress intensity
parallel to the surface and thus a shearing
stress.

Fig. Cl.l shows a circular solid shaft
subjected to a torsional moment. The portion
(A) of the shaft exerts a shearing stress ~z on
section (1-1) and portion (B) exerts a resisting shearing stress ~z on section (2-2). Fig.
Cl.2 illustrates a differential cube cut from
shaft between sections (1-1) and (2-2). For
equilibrium a resisting couple must exist on
top and bottom face of cube. Taking moments
about lower left edge of cube:


~x dxdy (dz)   - ~z dzdy (dx) = 0



hence, ~x = ~z - - - - - - 


- - - (1)



Thus if a shearing unit stress occurs on
one plane at a point in a body, a shearing unit
stress of same intensity eXists on planes at
right angles to the first plane.

Stresses.

unit dimensions SUbjected to pure shearing

Fig. Cl.4 shows a free body after the
block has been cut along a diagonal section.


For equilibrium the sum of the forces along
the x-x axis equals zero.

hence, 0 = 2 (~ 1 cos 451 ) cos 45 - - ~ (2)


Therefore when a point in a body is subjected to pure shear stresses of intensity ~,
normal stresses of the same intensity as the o
shear stresses are produced on a plane at 45
with the shearing planes.


Cl. 4 Principal Stresses


For a body SUbjected to any combination of
stresses 3 mutually perpendicular planes can be
found on which the shear stresses are zero. The
normal stresses on these planes of zero shear
stress are referred to as principal stresses.


Cl. 5 Shearing Stresses Resulting From Principal
Stresses.


In Fig. Cl.5 the differential block is
SUbjected to tensile principal stresses Ox and
Oz and zero principal stress 0Y' The block is
cut along a diagonal section giving the free
body of Fig. Cl.6. The stresses on the diagonal
section have been resolved into stress components parallel and normal to the section as shown.
For equilibrium the summation of the stresses
along the axes (1-1) and (2-2) must equal zero.

CL 9 Example Problems.


Example Problem 1.


The maximum normal and shear stresses will be
determined for the block loaded as shown in
Fig. Cl.12.


The graphical solution making use of Mohr's
circle is shown in Fig. Cl.13. From reference
axes x and z thru point 0, the given normal
stresses Ox = 10000 is laid off to scale on ox
and toward the right giving point B. From B the
shear stress ~xz = 5000 is laid off parallel to
oz to locate point C. With E the midpoint of
OB as the center of the circle and with radius
EC a circle is drawn which cuts the Ox axis at
F and G. The maximum and minimum principal
stresses are then equal to of and oG which
equals 12070 and -2070 respectively. The maximum shear stress equals EC or 7070.

Cl. 10 Triaxial or Three Dimensional Stresses


For bodies which are stressed in three
directions, the state of stress can be defined
completely by the six stress components as
illustrated in Fig. Cl.16. Using the same
procedure as was carried out for a two-dimensional stress system, it can be shown that there
are three principal stresses 01,' 0. and 0e,
whose values are the three roots of ° in the
following cubic equation.



/
Y Fig. Cl.16


Fig. Cl.17 shows the principal stress
system which replaces the system of Fig. Cl.16.
It can be shown that the maximum shear stress
max. is one of the following values.

Ymax. = [+ 1 ] -"2 (01 0.)


or _Y_ max. = -2 [+ 1 (02] 0,,) - - - - - -(15)


or, max. .". = + - 2 1 ( 0" - 01 )


The planes on which these shear stresses
act are indicated by the dashed lines in Fig.
Cl.lS, namely, adhe, bdge and dcef. The
largest of the shear stresses in equations (15)
depends on the rr.agnHude and signs of the
principal stresses, remembering that tension
is plus and compression is minus when making
the substitution in equations (15).

Cl. 11 Principal Strains

The strains under combined stresses are
usually expressed as strains in the direction
of the principal stresses. Consider a C8,se of
simple tension as illustrated in Fig. Cl.19.
The stress 01 causes a lengthening unit strain
_e_ in the direction of the stress 01' and a
shortening unit strain _e'_ in a direction at
right angles to the stress 01,.

Now consider the cubical element in Fig.

Cl. 12 Elastic Strain Energy


The strain energy in the elastic range for
the unit cube in Fig. Cl.20 when subjected to
combined stresses is equal to the work done by
the three gradually applied principal stresses

o~, oa and _0;._ These stresses produce strains
equal to E:~, E: a and E: s and thus the work done
per unit volume equals the strain energy. Thus
if U equals the strain energy, we obtain,

Cl. 13 Structural Design Philosophy. Limit and Ultimate
Loads. Factors of Safety. Margin of Safety.


The basic philosophy governing the
structural design of a flight vehicle is to
develop an adequate light weight structure that
will permit the vehicle to accomplish the
operations or missions that were established
as design requirements. The job of a
commercial airliner is to carry passengers and
cargo from place to place at the lowest cost.
To carry out this job a certain amount of
flight and ground maneuvering is reqUired and
the loads due to these maneuvers must be
carried safely and efficiently by the structure.
A military fighter airplane must be maneuvered
in flight far more severely to accomplish its
desired job as compared to the commercial airliner, thus the flight acceleration factors
for the military fighter airplane will be
considerably higher than that of the airliner.
In other words, every type of flight vehicle
will undergo a different load environment,
which may be repeated frequently or infrequently during the life of the vehicle. The
load environment may involve many factors such
as flight maneuvering loads, air gust loads,
take off and landing loads, repeated loads,
high and low temperature conditions, etc.


Limit Loads. Limit loads are the calculated
maximum loads which may be subjected to the
flight vehicle in carrying out the job it is
designed to accomplish during its life time
of use. The term limit was no doubt chosen
because every flight vehicle is limited
relative to the extent of its operations. A
flight vehicle could easily be designed for
loads greater than the limit loads, but such
extra strength which is not necessary for
safety would only increase the weight of the
structure and decrease the commercial or
military payload or in general be detrimental
to the design.


Factor of Safety. Factor of safety can be
defined as the ratio considered in structural
design of the strength of the structure to
the maximum calculated operational loads,
that is, the limit loads.


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-607-full.png)

Yield Factor of Safety. This term is defined
as the ratio of the yield strength of the
structure to the limit load.


Ultimate Factor of Safety. This term is
defined as the ratio of the ultimate strength
of the structure to the limit load.


Yield Load. This term is defined as the limit
load multiplied by the yield factor of safety.


Ultimate Load. This term can be defined as the
limit load multiplied by the ultimate factor
of safety. This resulting load is often
referred to by engineers as the design load,
which is misleading because the flight vehicle
structure must be designed to satisfy both
yield and ultimate failure and either one may
be critical.


Yield Margin of Safety. This term usually
expressed in percent represents the additional
yield strength of the structure over that
strength required to carry the limit loads.


Yield Margin of Safety -- Yield Limit Strength Load - 1


Ultimate Margin of Safety. This term usually
expressed in percent represents the additional
ultimate strength of the structure over that
strength required to carry the ultimate loads.


Ultimate Margin of Safety -_ Ultimate Ultimate Strength Load - 1


Cl. 14 Required Strength of Flight Structures.


Under Limit Loads:The flight vehicle structure shall be
designed to have sufficient strength to carry
simultaneously the limit loads and other
accompanying environmental phenomena for each
design condition without undergoing excessive
elastic or plastic deformation. Since most
materials have no definite yield stress, it is
common practice to use the unit stress where a
.002 inches per inch permanent set eXists as
the yield strength of the material, and in
general this yield strength stress can be used
as the maximum stress under the limit loads
unless definitely otherwise specified.


Under Ultimate Loads:The flight vehicle structure shall be
designed to withstand simultaneously the
ultimate loads and other accompanying environmental phenomena without failure. In general
no factor of safety is applied to the environmental phenomena but only to the limit loads.


Failure of a Structure:This term in general refers to a state or
condition of the structure which renders it



C1.7


incapable of performing its required function.
Failure may be due to rupture or collapse or
due to excessive deflection or distortion.


Cl. 15 Determination of the Ultimate Strength of a Structural
Member Under a Combined Load System. Stress
Ratio-Interaction Curve Method.


Since the structural designer of flight
vehicles must insure that the ultimate loads
can be carried by the structure without failure,
it is necessary that reliable methods be used
to determine the ultimate strength of a
structure. Structural theory as developed to
date is in general sufficiently developed to
accurately determine the ultimate strength of
a structural member under a single type of
loading, such as axial tension or compression,
pure bending or pure torsion. However, many
of the members which compose the structure of
a flight vehicle are subjected simultaneously
to various combinations of axial, bending and
torsional load systems and thus a method must
be available to determine the ultimate strength
of a structure under combined load systems.
A strictly theoretical approach appears too
difficult for solution since failure may be
due to overall elastic or inelastic buckling,
or the local elastic or inelastic instability.


The most satisfactory method developed to
date is the so-called stress ratio, interaction curve method, originally developed and
presented by Shanley. In this method the
stress conditions on the structure are represented by stress ratios, which can be considered as non-dimentional coefficients
denoting the fraction of the allowable stress
or strength for the member which can be
developed under the given conditions of combined loading.


For a single simple stress, the stress
ratio can be expressed as,


R = stress ratio = ~ -(22)


where f is the applied stress and F the
allowable stress. The margin of safety in
terms of the stress ratio R can be written,


1
M.S. = R- 1.0   - - - - - - - - - -(23)


Load ratios can be used instead of stress
ratios and is often more convenient.


For example for axial loading,


R - P/P a, where P = applied axial load
and Pa the allowable load.


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-608-full.png)

Cl. 8 COMBINED STRESSES. THEORY OF YIELD AND ULTIMATE FAILURE.



For pure bending,


R = MIMa, where M = applied bending
moment and Ma the allowable bending moment.


For pure torsion,


R = T/Ta, where T is applied torsional
moment and Ta the allowable torsional moment.


For combined loadings the general
conditions for failure are expressed by
Shanley as follows:

R~ + R~ + R~ + ------ = 1.0   - -(24)


In this above expression, R~, R 2 and R 3
could refer to compression, bending and shear
and the exponents x, y, and z give the
relationship for combined stresses. The
equation states that the failure of a
structural member under a combined loading will
result only when the sum of the stress ratios
is equal to or greater than 1.0.


For some of the simpler combined load
systems, the exponents of the stress ratios in
equation (24) can be determined by the various
well known theories of yield and failure that
have been developed. However, in many cases
of combined loading and for particular types
of structures the exponents in equation (24)
must be determined by making actual failure
tests of combined load systems.


Since the stress ratio method was presented by Shanley many years ago, much testing
has been done and as a result reliable interactiop equations with known exponents have
been obtained for many types of structural
members under the various combined load
systems. In a number of the following chapters,
the interaction equations which apply will be
used in determining the Ultimate strength
design of structural members.

Member Under a Combined Load System.



1. Maximum Principal Stress Theory
2. Maximum Shearing stress Theory
3. Maximum Strain Theory
4. Total Strain Energy Theory
5. Strain Energy of Distortion Theory
6. Octahedral Shear Stress Theory


The reader may review the explanation and
derivation of these 6 theories by referring
to such books as listed at the end of this
chapter.


Test results indicate that the yield
strength at a point in a stressed structure
is more accurately defined by theories 5 and
6 followed in turn by theory 2. Since
theories 5 and 6 give the same result, they
might be considered as the same general theory.
In this chapter we will only give the resulting
equations as derived by theory 6, since
theories 5 and 6 appear to be the theories
used in flight vehicle structural design.


Cl. 17 The Octahedral Shear Stress Theory.


Since this theory gives the same results
as the well known energy of distortion method
it is often referred to as the Equivalent
Stress Theory. The octahedral shear stress
theory may be stated as follows:- In elastic
action at any point in a body under combined
stress action begins only when the octahedral
shearing stress becomes equal to 0.47 fe'
where f e is the tensile elastic strength of
the material as determined from a standard
tension test. Since the elastic tensile
strength is somewhat indefinite, it is common
practice to use the engineering yield strength
Fty. In this theory it is assumed that the
tensile and compressive yield strengths are
the same.


Figs. Cl.21 and Cl.22 illustrate the
conditions of equilibrium involving the octahedral shear stress. In Fig. Cl.21, the cube
is SUbjected to the 3 principal stresses as
shown. A tetrahedron is cut from the cube
and shown in Fig. Cl.22. Three of the sides
of this tetrahedron are parallel to the



As explained in Art. Cl.14, the flight
vehicle structure must carry the limit loads
without yielding, which in general means the
yield strength of the material cannot be
exceeded when the structure is sUbjected to
the limit loads. In some parts of a flight
vehicle structure involving compact unit or
pressure vessels, biaxial or triaxial stress
conditions are often produced and it is
necessary to determine Whether any yielding
will occur under such combined stress action
when carrying the limit loads. For cases
where no elastic instability occurs, the
following well known theories of failure have
been developed.

side makes equal angles with the principal
axes. The octahedral shear and normal stresses
are the resulting stresses on the fourth side.


The equation for the value of the normal
octahedral stress is,

The equation for the octahedral shear
stress is,


Now the octahedral shear stress is 0.47
of the normal stress.


Let _t_ be the effective axial stress in
uniaxial tension or compression which results
in the given octahedral shear stress.

A cylindrical stiffened thin sheet fuselage is fabricated from 2024 aluminum alloy
sheet which has a tensile yield stress
Fty = 40000. Find the yield margin of safety
under the following limit load conditions.


(1) A limit bending moment produces a bending
stress of 37000 psi (tension) at top
point of fuselage section. The flexural
shear stress is zero at this point.



- (2) Same as condition (1) but pressurization
-(27) of fuselage produces a circumferential
tension stress of 8600 psi and a longitudinal tension stress of 4300 psi.



Therefore mUltiplying Eq. (26) by

triaxial stresses,



Let F equal the allowable tensile or
compressive stress. If the yield strength is
being determined then



(3) Same as condition (2) but a yawing

It is often more convenient to use the x, y

principal stresses. Fig. Cl.23 illustrates
the various component stresses.

SOLUTION: Condition (2)


There are no flexural shear stresses at
the fuselage point being considered. Since
no torsion is being applied
to fuselage no torsional
shear stresses exist. The
stress system at the point
being considered is thus a
biaxial stress system and

f~ and f 2 are principal
stresses.

the given tension

fx = 41300 psi. f z = 8600 psi. f s = 8000 psi.


Instead of finding the principal stresses
and using Eq. (30), we will use the fx and f z
stresses and use Eq. (32)


     - _Iss_ s
f = V fx + f z - fxf z + 3f s

The vessel wall is to be stressed to the
yield stress of 42000, thus f = 42000.


Whence

Solving, p = 970 psi.


PROBLEMS


(1) The combined stress loading at a point
in a structure is as follows:- fz =
-1000, fx = -2500, f s = 2000. Determine
the magnitude and direction of the

maximum shearing stress. Solve both
analytically and graphically.

CHAPTER C2

**STRENGTH** **OF** **COLUMNS WITH** **STABLE** **CROSS-SECTIONS**



C2.1 Methods of Column Failure. Column Equations.


In Chapter AlB, the theory of the elastic
and inelastic instability of the column was
presented. The equations from Chapter AlB
for a pin end support condition are:

For elastic primary failure,



The range AB in Fig. C2.1 is for a range
of Lip values of below 20 to 25, and represents a range where failure is due to plastic
crushing of the column. In other words, the
column is too short to buckle or bow under
end load but crushes under the high stresses.
This column range of stresses is usually
referred to as the block compression strength.


A column, however, may fail by local
buckling or crippling due to distortion of
the column cross-section in its own plane.
The horizontal dashed line in Fig. C2.1
represents the condition where the primary
column strength is limited by the local weakness. This line moves up or down according
to the value of the local weakness. The
determination of the column strength when
failure is due to local weakness is covered
in another chapter.


C2.2 Column End Restraint. Fixity Coefficients.
Column Effective Length.


The column strength is influenced by the
end support restraint against rotation and by
any lateral supports between the column ends.
The letter c is commonly used to indicate the
end fixity coefficient, and c = 1.0 for zero
end restraint against rotation, which can be
produced mechanically by a pin or ball and
socket end support fitting. Thus including
the end restraint effect equations (1) and (2)
can be written,



F c =




- - - - - - - - - (1)



For inelastic primary failure,


F c =   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   - (2)


Where Fc = compressive unit stress at
failure = _piA_ stress.


E = Young's modulus
Et = tangent modulus


L = column length


p = radius of gyration of crosssection


Fig. C2.1 shows a typical plot of Fc
versus Lip. If the column dimensions are such
as to cause it to fail in range CD in Fig.
C2.1, the primary failure is due to elastic
instability and equation (1) holds. This
range of Lip values is often referred to by
engineers as the long column range.

C2.6 strength of Columns with Variable Cross-Section
or Moment of Inertia.


To save weight in a built up column or
forged column, the member is tapered or is
made with a non-uniform cross-sect1on. To
find the ultimate strength of such columns,
it is usually necessary to use a trial and
error method. The general method of solution
involving a consideration of column deflection
will be illustrated for a case of a long
column with uniform cross-section.


Fig. C2.18 shows a pin ended column in a
deflected neutral equilibrium position when
carrying the ultimate or critical load P.
Assume that the shape of the deflected column
follows a sine curve relationship with the
deflection at midpoint equal to unity (see
Fig. C2.18).


The equation of the deflected column

curve is y = sin nx If P is the end load, the
L



Thus in Fig. C2.18, the deflection of
point (0) away from tangent at midpoint c
equals unity in our assumed conditions and it
also equals the first moment of the area of
the M/EI diagram between (0) and (C) about (0).
(Fig. C2.19).


The value of the ordinate for M/EI diagram
at any point x from 0 is EI P sin L 1l X

The total area under the curve is,


area =- P _1_ L sin -x 1l dx =- P [L - - cos - x n] L
EI 0 L EI n L 0

= :1 - {[~ (- l)J [- - (l)J} = ~ (~ + *)


hence area = 2PL and half area = PL
nEI nEI


The center of gravity of the half area is


Ai = _1_ x da


P L/2
( PL) -nEI x _[=-1]_ EI x sin [- x dx,
0


L _ L/2

   - x = _1_ x sin ~ x dx
1l 0


Integrating this simple expression and solving
for x we obtain:


x = L/n


Taking moments about point (0) of the M/EI
diagram between 0 and C about 0:



bending moment at any point = M = Py = P
sin L n x - Yo = 1 = PL L = PL [B]
nEI n nBEI



hence, P = nBEI

L B



By the well known "moment area" principle
(see Chapter A7; Art. A7.14), the deflection
of a point (A) on the elastic curve away from
a tangent to elastic curve (B) equals the first
moment of the M/EI diagram between (A) and (B)
about (A).



which is the Euler equation, and thus the
assumed sine curve was the proper one for the
deflected elastic curve of the column.


Suppose that the elastic curve of deflected column had been assumed as a parabola
With unit deflection at midpoint. Fig. C2.20
shows the M/EI diagram.


The area of one-half the diagram =
12 P _PL
2" ('3 Lx EI) - 3EI


Taking moments about 0 of the area between 0
and C;

Yo = 1 - 3EI 16 L - 48EI hence,

C2.9


(9) Solve for load P by writing an expression
for the deflection at the center point
which equals unity. This is done by
using the moment area principle as was
done in the previous example problem involving a column with uniform section.


In the above outlined procedure, E has
been assumed constant or, in other words, the
column failure is elastic or failing stresses
are below the proportional limit stress of the
material. The practical problem usually
involves a slenderness ratio where failure is
due to inelastic bending and thus E is not
constant. For this case, a trial and error
method of solution in necessary using the
tangent modulus of elasticity which varies
with stress in the inelastic stress range.


C2.7 Design Column Curves for Columns with NonUniform Cross-Section.

Figs. C2.21 and C2.22 give curves for
rapid solution of two types of stepped columns.
Figs. C2.23 and C2.24 gives curves for the
rapid solution of two forms of tapered columns.
Use of these curves will be illustrated later
in this chapter.


C2.8 Column Fixity Coefficients c for Use with Columns
with Elastic Side Restraints and Known End
Bending Restraint.


Figs. C2.25 and C2.26 give curves for
finding fiXity coefficient c for columns with
one and two elastic lateral restraints and
Fig. C2.27 gives curves for finding c when
restraining moments at column ends are known.
Use of these various curves will be
illustrated later.


C2.9 Selection of Materials for Elevated Temperature
Conditions.


Light weight is an important requirement
in aerospace structural design. For columns
that fail in the inelastic range of stresses,
a comparison of the Fcy/W ratio of materials
gives a fairly good picture of the efficiency
of compression members when subjected to

We can now apply the same procedure to
a column with non-uniform cross-section. The
steps in this procedure for a column
symmetrical about the center point are as
follows:

(1) Assume a sine curve for the deflected
column with unit deflection at center
point.


(2) Plot a moment of inertia (I) curve for
column cross-section.


(3) Find the bending moment curve due to end
load P times the lateral deflection.


(4) Divide these moment values by the EI
values to obtain M/EI curve. The modulus
of elasticity E is considered constant.


(5) Find the deflected column curve due to
this M/EI loading.


(6) Compare the shape of the derived column
deflection curve with that originally
assumed as a sine curve. This can be
done by multiplying the computed deflections by a factor that makes the
center deflection equal to unity. Since
the assumed sine curve is not the true
column deflection curve, the computed
deflection will differ somewhat from the
sine curve.


(7) With the computed deflection curve,
modified to give unity at center point,
repeat steps 3, 4, 5 and 6. The results
this time will show derived deflection
curve still closer to the assumed
deflection curve.


(8) To obtain the desired accuracy, the procedure in step (7) will usually have to
be repeated again.

TEMP. of


a compression member. Find the ultimate
strength of the member if made from the
following materials and subjected to the
temperature and time conditions.



Solution:


Since the column may fail by bending about
either the X or Y axes, the column strength for
bending about each of these axes will be calculated. Since the column strength is a function
of the radius of gyration of the cross-section,
the first step in the solution will be the calculation of Ix and Iy, from which p x and Py can
be found.


Calculating Ix: In Fig. C2.30 the section will
be first considered a solid rectangle 2.5 x
2.75 and then the properties of portions (1)
and (2) will be subtracted.


Ix (rectangle) = I2x 1 2.5 X 2.75 3 = 4.32


Portions (1) and (2)


Ix = -12 1 x 1.5 x 1.25 - 4 .625 x .25 x 3 ( 1.292 ") =

-1.29


(1 0 of (2) about its x centroidal axis is
negligible)


Ix = 4.32 - 1.29 = 3.03 in. 4

Column strength is considerably influenced
by the end restraint conditions. For failure
by bending about the x-x axis, the end restraint
against rotation is zero as the single fitting
bolt has an axis parallel to the x-x axis and
thus c the fiXity coefficient is 1. For
failure by bending about the y-y axis we have
end restraint which will depend on the rigidity
of the bolt and the adjacent fitting and
structure. For this example problem, this
restraint will be such as to make the end
fiXity coefficient c = 1.5.



![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-622-2.png)
![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-623-full.png)

For failure about x-x axis,


L' = L/v'C= 30/v'l= 30, L'/px = 30/ .83

= 36


For failure about y-y axis,


L' = 30/.,[1:5= 24.6, L'/Py = 24.6/.60

= 41


Therefore failure is critical for bending
about y-y axis, with L'/p = 41.


Case 1. The material is 7079-T6 Alum. Alloy
hand forging. Fig. C2.14 gives the failing
stress Fc for this material plotted against
the L'/p ratio. Thus using L'/p = 41 and the
room temperature curve, we read Fc = 50500 psi.
Thus the failing load if P = FcA = 50500 x
4.375 = 220,000 lbs.


Case 2. Using the 300 [0] F curve in Fig. C2.14
for the same L'/p value, we read Fc = 40,400,
and thus P = 40,400 x 4.375 = 177,000.


Case 3. Using the 600 [0] F curve, Fc reads 6100
and thus P = 6100 x 4.375 = 26700 lbs. Thus
subjecting this member to a temperature of
600 [0] F for 1/2 hour reduces its strength from
220,000 to 26,700 lbs., which means that
Alum. Alloy is a poor material for carrying
loads under such temperatures since the
reduction in strength is quite large.


Case 4. Material 17-4 PH stainless steel
forging. Fig. C2.8 gives the column curves
for this material. For L' /p = 41 and using
the room temperature curve we read Fc =
135,200 and thus P = 135,200 x 4.375 =
591,000 lbs.


C2.10 Solution Without Using Column Curves.


When primary bending failure occurs at
stresses above the proportional limit stress,
the failing stress is given by equation (5)
which is,


Since Et is the tangent modulus of
elasticity, it varies with Fc ' and thus the
relation of Et to Fc must be known before the
equation can be solved. To plot column curves
for all materials in their many manufactured
forms plus the various temperature conditions
would require several hurldred individual
column charts. The use of such curves can be
avoided if we know several values or parameters
regarding the material as presented by
Ramsburg and Osgood and expanded by Cozzone
and Melcon (see Arts. C2.4 and C2.5) for use
in column design.



C2.13


Thus we make use of the curves in Fig.
C2.17.


Case 1. Material 7079-T6 Alum. Alloy forging.
Table Bl.l of Chapter Bl summarizes certain
material properties. The properties needed
to use Fig. C2.17 are the shape factor n, the
moduls Ec and the stress Fa.?' Referring to
Table Bl.l, we find that n = 26, Ec =
10,500,000 and Fa.? = 59,500.


The horizontal scale in Fig. C2.17 involves the parameter,


B = l ~ Fa.? (L' /p)
n E c


Substituting:

B [_ 1] _[ j]_ 59,500 (41) 1 01

   - n 10,500,000 =.


Using Fig. C2.17 with 1.01 on bottom
scale and projecting vertically upward to
n = 26 curve and then horizontal to scale at
left side of chart we read Fc/F a .? = .842.


Then Fc = 59,500 x .842 = 50,100, as
compared to 50,500 in the previous solution
using Fig. C2.14.


Case 2. From Table Bl.l for this material
subjected to a temperature of 600 [0] F for 1/2
hour, we find n = 29, Fc = 9,400,000 and
**F** **a •** **7** **=** **46,500.**


Then B = l _vi_ 46,500 (41) = .917
n 9,400,000


From Fig. C2.17 for B = .917 and n = 29,
we read Fc/F a .? = .88, thus Fc = 46,500 x .88
= 40,900 as compared to 40,400 in the previous
solution.

C2.14 STRENGTH OF COLUMNS WITH STABLE CROSS-SECTIONS



to this table gives,


A = .594 sq. in. Px = .618


L' = L, sin c = 1, L'/px = 32/.618 = 51.7


Fig. C2.11 gives the column curves for
this material. For L' /p = 51.7 and room
temperature we read Fc = 38,500 psi.


Solution by using Fig. C2.17,


From Table Bl.l, n = 8.8, Ec = 7,800,000
and F O • 7 = 29,000.


B = ~ y ~~l7,~~O~ggo~~ (51.7) = 1.00


From Fig. C2.17 we find Fc /F o • 7 = .74


Then Fc = .74 x 29,000 = 21,450 psi


Consider the member is SUbjected to a
temperature of 450 [0] F for 1/2 hour.


From Fig. C2.11, Fc = 21400 psi


Using Fig. C2.17:

From Table Bl.l, n = 8.8, Ec = 7,800,000
and F O • 7 = 29,000.


_ 1 _j_ _29,000_
B - n 7,800,000 (51.7) = 1.00


From Fig. C2.17 we find Fc /F o • 7 = .74


Then Fc = .74 x 29,000 = 21,450 psi


A very common aluminum alloy in aircraft
construction is 2014-T6 extrusions. Let it
be required to determine the allowable stress
Fc for our member when made of this material.


Since we have not presented column curves
for this material, we will use Fig. C2.17.


From Table Bl.l, for our material, we
find n = 18.5, Ec = 10,700,000 and F O • 7 =
53,000


Then B -- 1 nv / 10,700,000 53,000 (51 7). = 1.10


From Fig. Cl.17 for B = 1.16 and n = 18.5,
we read Fc /F o • 7 = .71, hence Fc = .71 x
53,000 = 37,600.


The result shows that the 2014-T6 material
gave a failing stress of 37,600 as compared to
38,900 for the 7075-T6 material which has a
Fcy of 70,000 as compared to F cy = 53,000 for
the 2014-T6 material. The reason for the
7075 material not showing much higher column
failing stress Fc over that for the 2014 alloy



is due to the fact that the stress existing
under a L' /p value of 51.7 is near the proportional limit stress or Et is not much
different than Ec, the elastic modulus.


To illustrate a situation where the 7075
material becomes more efficient in comparison
to the 2014 alloy, let us assume that our
member has a rigid connection at its end which
will develop an end restraint equivalent to a
fixity coefficient c = 2.


Then L' = 32/y'2:= 22.6 and L'/p =
22.6/.618 = 36.7.


For the 7075 material from Fig. C2.11, Fc =
58,300


For the 2014 material, we use Fig. C2.17

B = ~ v ~~i~~ 53,000 (36.7) = .823.
n 10,700,000


From Fig. C2.17 for B = .823 and n =
18.5, we read Fc /F o • 7 = .87, when Fc = .87 x
53,000 = 46,100 as compared to 58,300 for the
7075 material, thus 7075 material would permit
lighter weight of required structural material.


The student should realize that if the
stress range is such as to make Et = Ec ' then
the bending failure is elastic instead of
inelastic and equation (5), using Young's
modulus of elasticity Ec ' can be solved
directly without resort to column curves or
a consideration of Et, since Et is equal to
E c '


The student should realize that equation
(5) is for strength under primary column
failure due to bending as a whole and not due
to local buckling or crippling of the member
or by twisting failure. The subject of
column design when local failure is involved
is covered in a later chapter.


In example problem 2, we have assumed
that local crippling is not critical, which
calculation will show is true as explained
and covered in a later chapter.


C2. 12 Strength of Stepped Column.


The use of curves in Fig. C2.22 will be
illustrated by the solution for the strength
of two stepped columns in order to illustrate
both elastic and inelastic failure of such
columns.


Case 1. Elastic failure.


Fig. C2.32 shows a double stepped pin
ended column. The member is machined from a
1 inch diameter extruded rod made from


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-625-full.png)

7075-T6 material. The problem is to find the
maximum compressive load this member will
carry.

From Fig. C2.22) P cr = B(EIJ.) • L 2 This is
the Euler equation for failure under elastic
bending. If the ratio aiL equals 1 or a
uniform section, B becomes n [2] or 10 as shown
in Fig. C2.22. The curves in Fig. C2.22
apply only to elastic failure. Since the
member in Fig. C2.32 is rather slender we
will assume the failure is elastic and then
check this assumption.



C2.15


This is a relatively short column so the
failing stress should fall in the inelastic
range where E is not constant, therefore the
solution is a trial and error procedure. We
will base our first guess or trial on an
average L/p value.


p for portion 1 is 0.25 inches


p for portion 2 is 0.1875


Average p = (6 x .25 + 6 x 0.1875)/12
**=** **0.22**


Then L/p = 12/0.22 = 54.5, use 55.


Fig. C2.11 is a column curve for 7075-T6
Alum. Alloy extruded material. With L/p =
55, we read allowable stress Fc = 33,500 psi.
Therefore


P = Fc A = 33,500 x 0.7854 = 26,300 lb.


f 1 = 33,500 and f 2 = 26,300/.4418
**=** **59,500** **0**



The stress f

EI 2 = 10,500,000 x .0155 = 3.17,



aiL = 30/60

**=** **0.5**



Referring to Table Bl.l in Chapter Bl,
we find the folloWing values for 7075-T6
extrusions:- n = 16.6, F O • 7 = 72,000,
Ec = 10,500,000.


The tangent modulus Et will be found for
the stresses fJ. and f 2 •


For Portion 1, f 1 /F o • 7 = 33,500/72,000
**=** **.465**


Referring to Fig. C2.16 and using 0.465
and n = 16.6, we read Et/E = 1.0, thus Et =
E and thus no plasticity correction for
Portion 1.


For Portion 2, f 2 /F o • 7 = 59,500/72,000
= .826


From Fig. C2.16, we obtain Et/E = .675
whence, Et = .675 x 10,500,000 = 7,090,000.



From Fig. C2.22 for aiL = 0.5 and EI 1 /EI 2
**=** **3.17** **we** **read** **B** **=** **7.0**



Whence, P cr = BEll: L 2 =



7 x 10,500,000 x .0491 =

1000 lb.



The stresses in each portion are,


f 1 = 1000/0.7854 = 1280 psi


f 2 = 1000/.4418 = 2270 psi


These compressive stresses are below the
proportional limit stress of the material so
Ec is constant and our solution is correct.


Case 2. Inelastic Failure.


The column has been shortened to the
dimensions as shown in Fig. C2.33. The
diameters and material remain the same as in
Case 1.



From Fig. C2.22 for aiL = .5, we obtain
B = 5.6.

The member AB is welded to three adjacent
tubes at joints (A) and (B). Since these
tubes are the same at joints (A) and (B), the

is the same.

This practically checks the assumed value,
thus the answer is between 23,500 and 23,650
and if further accuracy is desired another
trial should be carried through.


The other types of columns with nonuniform cross-sections as shown in Figs.
C2.21, C2.23 and C2.24 are solved in a similar
manner. These charts are to be used only with
pin ended columns. The end fixity coefficient
c for tapered columns is not the same as for
uniform section columns.


C2. 13 Column Strength With Known End Restraining
Moment.


.Fig. C2.27 shows curves for finding the
end fixity coefficient c for two conditions
of known end bending restraint.


To illustrate the use of these curves,
a simple problem will be solved.


Fig. C2.34 shows a 3-bay welded steel
tubular truss. The problem is to determine
the allowable compressive stress for member
AB. This strength is influenced by the fixity
existing at ends A and B. The diameter and
wall thickness of each tube in the truss is
shown on the figure. The material is AIBI
steel, Ftu = 90,000, Fty = 70,000, E =
29,000,000.



Referring to Fig. C2.27, the term ~ is
defined as the bending restraint coefficientspring constant expressed as inch pounds per
radian. In Fig. A,
the moment M reend quired (A) to through rotate 1 u"-+ lV\. ~=------=:":"':'--- t~ A EI (constant) __
radian when far end
is fixed is 4EI/L. Fig. A
For derivation of
this value refer to Art. All.4 of Chapter
All. If the far end (B) is pinned in
(Fig. A), a moment M = 3EI/L will rotate end
(A) through one radian. To be slightly
conservative, we will assume the far ends of
members coming into joints (A) and (B) as
pinned. Thus ~ = 3EI/L. The sum of ~ =
3EI/L will be computed for the 3 members
which form the support of member AB at end
(A) •



Member AC:- I = .03867, I/L = .001289
Member AE:- I = .02775, IlL = .00071
Member AF:- I = .02402, I/L = .000962


~ = Z 3EI/L

= 3( .001289 + .00071 + .000962) 29,000,000


~ = 258,000


In Fig. C2.27 we need term ~ L/EI. The
L/EI refers to member AB. Thus ~ L/EI =
(258,000 x 30 )/29,000,000 x .0367 = 7.28.


We use the upper curve in Fig. C2.27
since restraint at both ends of member AB
is the same. Thus for ~ L/EI = 7.28, we
read end fixity coefficient c = 2.58.


Then L' = L/v'C = 30!V 2.58 = 18.6.


p for member = .422 inches.


L'/p = 18.6/.422 = 44.0


From column curve in Fig. C2.3, we read


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-627-full.png)

allowable failing stress to be Fc = 55,200
psi.


If the far ends of the connecting members
were assumed fixed instead of pinned, then

~ = 4EI/L, or we can multiply previous value
of 7.28 by 4/3, which gives 9.7 which, used in
Fig. C2.27, gives c = 2.80.


L' /p = 30/v'"2:8 x .422 = 42.5. Then from
Fig. C2.3, Fc = 56,600 psi. Since the far
ends are less than fixed, the assumption that
far ends are pinned gives fairly accurate
results.


In a truss structure all members are
carrying axial loads and axial loads affect
the ability of members to resist rotation of
their ends. Art. All.12 of Chapter All
explains how to take account of the effect
of axial load upon the stiffness of a member
as required in calculating the end restraint
coefficient ~.

**CHAPTER** **C3**

**YIELD** **AND** **ULTIMATE STRENGTH** **IN** **BENDING**



**C3. 1 Introduction.**


Members subjected to bending alone or in
combination with axial and torsional loads are
qUite comnon in flight vehicle structures.
The limit design loads on a structural member
must be carried without permanent distortion

~nd the ultimate design loads must be carried
without rupture or failure. The well known
bending stress equation f b = Mc/I, assumes a
linear variation of stress with strain or, in
other words, the equation holds for stresses
below the proportional limit stress or, in
general, the elastic range. Failure of a
member in bending, unless there is local
weakness, does not occur at stresses in the
elastic range but occurs at stresses in the
inelastic range. Since the ultimate strength
of a member is needed to compare against the
ultimate design load to be carried, a theory
or procedure is n3cessary which will accurately
determine the ultimate and yield strength of a
member in bending.


**C3.2** **Basic** **Approach to Finding the Bending Strength**
**of** **Members.**


The problem is to determine the internal
resisting moment of a beam section when subjected to stresses which fall in the inelastic
range of stresses. This stress can be taken
as the ultimate tensile or compressive stress
of the material or limited to some stress or
deformation in the inelastic range. To obtain
the true internal resisting moment, we must
_knryN_ how the normal tension and compressive
stress varies over the cross-section. The
stress-strain cu~ve for the material provides
the source for obtaining the true stress
picture. If a material has a different shape
in the tensile and compressive inelastic
zones, the neutral axes does not coincide with
the centroidal axis, thus adding some difficult
to an analysis method. The analysis procedure
for determining the true internal resisting
moment is best explained by an example
solution.


**C3.3** **Bending Strength of a Solid Round** **Bar.**


Fig. C3.1a shows the cross-section of a
round solid bar made of aluninum alloy. The
stress-strain curve up to a unit strain of
.010 in. per inch is given in Fig. C3.2. Note
that the shape of the curve in the inelastic
zone is not the same for both tension and



compression. In this example solution, we will
find the internal resisting moment when we
limit the unit strain at the extreme edge on
the compressive side of the beam section to
0.010. Now plane sections remain plane after
bending in both elastic and inelastic stress
conditions when member is in pure bending.
We will guess the neutral axis as located
0.0375 inches above the centroidal axis as
shown in Fig. C3.1b. Having assumed the

maximu~ unit strain as .010, we can draw the
strain diagram of Fig. C3.1b. We now divide
the cross-section in Fig. C3.1a into 20
narrow horizontal strips. Having the strain
curve in Fig. C3.1b, we can find the unit

C3.2 YIELD AND ULTIMATE STRENGTH IN BENDING



strain at the midpoint of each strip. With the
strain known on each strip, the stress existing
can be found by use of the stress-strain curve
in Fig. C3.2. The total load on each strip
then equals the stress times the area of the
strip. The internal resisting moment then
equals the summation of the load on each
strip times the distance from the strip to
the neutral axis.


Table C3.1 shows the detail calculations.
If the neutral axis has been selected in the
correct position, the values in column (6)
of the table should add up to zero since total
tension must equal the total compression on
the beam cross-section. The small discrepancy
of 740 pounds in the s~~ation of column (6)
is not enough to change the location of the
neutral axis or the total internal resisting
moment appreciably. Column (7) gives the
total internal resisting moment as 56735 in.
lbs. when the strain is limited to the .010
strain as previously discussed. The stress
at this strain from Fig. C3.2 is 49000 psi.
Using this stress in the well known beam
formula M = fIle, we obtain M = 49000 x 0.785
= 38450, which is much less than the true
value of 56735.

Since it is desirable to use the beam
formula in finding bending stresses due to a



given bending moment, and also for detennining
the true internal resisting moment of a beam
section, structural design engineers make use
of a fictitious failing bending stress Fb,
which is referred to as a modulus of rupture
stress in pure bending. Then the ultimate
bending moment that can be developed by a
given beam cross-section and a given material
is M = FbI/C. Design curves for finding Fb'
the modulus of rupture, are given later in
this chapter.


Since there are many flight vehicle
materials and all kinds of shapes used in
structural members, the basic approach for
solution as illustrated in Table C3.1 becomes
very time consuming. Design engineers always
search for simplified methods which give
sufficient accuracy. Thus Cozzone (Ref. 1)
has developed a simplified procedure for
finding the modulus of yield or rupturing
bending stress Fb' The method is widely used
in the aerospace industry in structural
design.


C3.4 The Cozzone Simplified Procedure.


The Cozzone method in its simplest form
assumes a symmetrical rectangular beam section
and the same shape of the stress-strain curve
in both tension and compression. Fig. C3.3
represents the true bending stress variation
over the beam cross-section when failure
occurs. Cozzone now replaces this true curve
by a trapizoidal stress variation as shown in
Fig. C3.4. The stress f o is a fictitious
stress which is assumed to exist at the neutral
axis or at zero strain.

C3.3



The value of f o is determined by making
the requirement that the internal moment of
the true stress system must equal the moment
of the assumed trapezoidal stress system
which results from the assumed stress-strain
curve as shown in Fig. C3.5. Fig. C3.6 shows
the trapezoidal stress pattern drawn to a
larger scale and showing only one half of the
sy,rrmetrial beam section. The trapezoidal
stress pattern has been divided into a
rectangle (r) and a triangle (b) as shown in
the figure.


Let, Mb = total internal resisting moment.
mr = internal moment developed by
portion (r).
mb = internal moment developed by
portion (b).


Since fb varies linearly from zero to fb'
the stress is elastic and thus the beam
equation holds, or


mb = fbllc for entire bea~ section. The
stress variation on portion (r) is constant or
rectangular, thus

The modulus of rupture may be limited to a stress
between the yield and Ultimate stress of the
material because of local crippling or by
excessive distortion. Regardless of what value
is used for fm in equation (3), the corresponding value of f o must be kno'WTI before the
value of Fb can be determined. Figs. C3.9 to
C3.23 give strain curves for various material
and the corresponding f o curve. The use of
these two curves permit the determination of
Fb if the k shape factor for the particular
beam section being considered is known. In
deriving the values of f o, the following
assumptions are made.


(1) The stress-strain curve is assumed
the same in tension and compression.


(2) The neutral axis is assumed to coincide with the centroidal axis.


(3) During bending plane sections remain
plane.


(4) The cross-section is not subject to
local or torsional instability.



The values of k vary between 1 and 2.0.
If calculated value of k is greater than 2
use 2.0. Fig. C3.7 shows the value of the
shape factor k for several typical shapes.
Fig. C3.8 shows curves for the rapid
determination of the k factor for 3 common
beam sections.

C3.6 General Accuracy of Method.



(1) It is exact for a rectangular section
under pure bending with moment vector parallel
to a principal axis.


(2) For double s~metric sections under
pure bending and moment vector parallel to a
principal axis, the accuracy should be within
5 percent.


(3) Single s~metric sections will vary
from practically exact to definitely unconservative (moment vector normal to axis of
sYilunetry) .


(4) For sections subject to combined
bending and axial load, the results will vary
from practically exact to conservative.


(5) For unsymnetrical bending, with and
without axial load, the results will vary from
practically exact to conservative.


C3.7 Example Problems in Finding Bending Strength.


KXAMPLE PROBLEM 1.


A rectangular bean section is 0.25 inches
wide and 1.5 inches deep. What yield and
ultimate bending moment will the section
develop when made from 7075-T6 extruded
alLLminum alloy.


Solution: The modulus of bending stress is
given by equation (3),



Fb = f m + f o (k - 1) - - - - 

k = 2Q = 2 x 0.75 x .25 x .375 x =
I/c 1

Fb = 65000 + 29000 (1.5 - 1) = 79500 psi.
yield


Then yield bending moment = Myp = FbI/c


Thus Myp = 79500 x .0938 = 7460 in. lb.


For finding the ultimate resisting
bending, we use Ftu which is 75000 as the
value of fm in equation (3). Again going to
Fig. C3.17 to stress of 75000 on stress-strain
curve and the vertically d01m to f o curve, we
obtain f o = 70500.


Then Fb(Ult)= 75000 + 70500(1.5-1)= 110250 psi


Then MUlt = FbI/c = 110250x.0938 = 10370 in. lb.


Let us asswne that is is desired to limit
the strain in the extreme fiber to .03 inches
per inch. What would be the bending moment
developed under this limitation.


From Fig. C3.17 for a unit strain of .03
the corresponding stress from the stress
strain curve is 74700 and the f o stress is
61200.


Then Fb = 74700 + 61200 (1.5-1) = 105300


Then M = FbI/c = 105300 x .0938 = 9900 in. lb.


EXAMPLE PROBLEM 2.


The symmetrical I beam section in Fig.

bending moment M = 14000 in. lb. What is
the margin of safety if
the beam is made of

and Fty = 22000.

The value of k could also be found in Fig.
C3.7.


Material is 7075-T6 aluminum alloy. From
Fig. C3.17, Ftu = 75000, Fty = 65000.


To find the yield bending strength, the
value of fm in equation (3), the maximum
stress permitted on the most remote fiber is
65000, the yield stress of the material. To
find f o, we go to Fig. C3.17 and find the
point on the stress-strain curve that
corresponds to a stress of 65000. This point
is projected vertically downward to intersect
the curve f o• This point is then projected
to the stress scale at the edge of the chart


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-633-full.png)

From Fig. C3.19, for fm = Ftu = 38000 we
find in projecting vertically downward to f o
curve gives f o = 23700. Then sUbt. in
equation (3)


Fb = 38000 + 23700 (1.17 - 1) = 40770


MUlt = FbI/c = 40770 x .358 = 15000 in. lb.

bending strength was developed. From Fig.
C3.19, the unit strain when stress is 38000
is .035. Then since plane sections remain
plane after bending, the unit strain at point
.50 inch from neutral axis is (.5/1) (.035) =
.0175. From Fig. C3.19, the stress existing
at this strain is f = 31000 psi. A linear
variation of stress as used in the flexural
equation would give half the maximum stress
or 38000/2 = 19000 psi as against the true
stress of 31000.

The lower edge of the beam section is strained
to the maximum value of .035 as shown on the

**.61/1.39** **=** **.0154.**


Solution 1


Equation (3) was derived for a symmetrical
section about the neutral axis. The equation
involves finding the resisting moment
developed by one half the beam section and
multiplying by 2. This is permissible since
the unit strain at both top and bottom edges
is the same. In this solution we will continue
to use equation (3). To do this it is
necessary to make symmetrical sections for the



I 1 /c 1 = 0.178/1.39 = .128


Q1 = 1.39 x 0.1 x .695 = .0965


k 1 = _2_ _[n]_ ~1 [ /1] [ /] 1 C [1] = 0.1930.128 = 1 5•


From Fig. C3.22, Ftu = 180000 which equals


f o from curve = 156000


Then Fb 1 = fm + f o (k - 1)

= 180000 + 156000 (1.5   - 1) = 258000


M = (Fb1I1/C1)~ = 258000 x .128 x


0.5 = 16550 in. lb.


The factor 1/2 is due to the fact that
portion (1) is only one half the beam section
in Fig. (d).

The stress for a unit strain of .0154
from the stress strain curve in Fig. C3.22 is

Solution 2.


Instead of making each portion a

s~rrnetrical section as was done in solution (1)
and dividing the results by two, we will find
the internal bending resistance of each portion
as is when bending about the neutral axis of
the entire section. Equation (3) now becomes
for each portion of beam section,


Fb = f m + f o (k   - 1)   - - - 3'

to neutral axis of entire beam section. Fig.

C3.10 YIELD AND ULTIMATE STRENGTH IN BENDING



C3.11 Alternate More Exact Method for Complex
Bending.


A beam section when resisting a pure
external bending moment bends about an axis
that is called the neutral axis. No matter
what the shape of the beam cross-section for
any given external moment, there is an axis
about which bending takes place. The general
case involves an unsymmetrical beam crosssection and material which has different
stress-strain curves in compression and
tension in the inelastic range. The neutral
axis therefore does not pass through the
centroid of the cross-section and thus the
method of solution is a trial and error
approach. The solution procedure is outlined
in Chapter A19, Article A19.17, and therefore
will not be repeated here. Also the chapter
dealing with the design of beams with nonbuckling webs explains and illustrates how
the ultimate bending resistance of an entire
beam section is determined.


C3.12 Strength Under Combined Bending and
Flexural Shear.


The previous part of this chapter has
dealt with the determination of the strength
of a beam section in pure bending. The usual
beam design problem involves flexural shear
with bending. In finding the true internal
resisting moment, the Cozzone simplified
method derives a trapezoidal bending stress
distribution which will produce the same
internal resisting moment as the true internal
bending stress system. A triangular stress
system is then derived which will also give
the true bending moment.


Now the equation for flexural shear stress
for a triangular bending stress distribution
is



f = VQ
s It



(A)



Thus to use equation (A) for a
trapizoidal bending stress, a correction factor
(C) must be applied or equation (A) becomes


f s -       - CVQ It       -       - -       - - (B)


To illustrate how the correction factor
(C) can be determined, the I beam section used
in example problem (2) will be used.


We will assume the ultimate design moment
of 14000 in. lbs. is produced by a load of
600 lbs. acting on a cantilever beam at a
point 23.30 inches from the fixed end of the
beam. Thus the beam section at the support
is subjected to bending moment of 14000 and



a shear V-=600 Ibs. The problem is to find
the margin of safety under this combined
loading.


For pure bending only the stress ratio is

Rb =lL = 14000 = .933 (the value of 15000 is
Ma 15000

obtained from example problem 2).


The stress ratio in shear is Rs = fs/F su,
where f s is the flexural shear stress and Fsu
the ultimate shear stress of the material.
The problem therefore is to find the value of
f s '


The eqUivalent trapezoidal and triangular
bending stress distribution will be determined
for the design bending moment of 14000 in. lbs.


For a triangular stress variation,
Fb = Mc/I = 14000/0.358 = 39150 psi.


From example problem (2) the shape factor
k was 1.17. On Fig. C3.19, the curve for
k = 1.17 has been plotted. Starting with the
Fb stress of 39150 at the left scale, run
horizontal to an intersection with the k =
1.17 curve, the projecting vertically downward to intersections with the stress- strain
curve and the f o curve to give 35800 for fm and
19700 for f o' The stress results are shown
graphically in Fig. C3.28a and Fig. C3.28b.

The flexural shear stress is a function
of the rate of change of the bending stress.
Thus we can obtain a shear correction factor
C by comparing the bending stresses in the
two stress distribution diagram.


The shear stress is maximum at the
neutral axis in this particular problem.
The total normal force on the cross-section
of beam above the neutral axis equals the
stress times the area.


For simplification, the beam section will
be divided into the two portions labeled (a)
and (b).


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-639-full.png)

For Case 1:

Load on portion (a) is,


19700 x 1.375 x 0.125 = 3380 lb.


16100 + 2 14100 x 1.375 x 0.125 = 2600 lb.


Portion (b)


19700 x 0.875 x 0.125 = 2155


14100 x 0.5 x 0.875 x 0.125 = 771


Total Force 8906 lbs.

Thus the correction factor is,

Then f s at neutral axis is,

the cross-section will be determined. The
correction factor for this point is found by
comparing the loads on portion (a) for Case 1
and Case 2 stress patterns.


Case 1. Load on (a) = 3380 + 2600 = 5980


Case 2. Load on (a) = 6300.


Hence, C = 5980/6300 .95


C3. **13** Strength Under Combined Bending Flexural Shear

C4. 1 Introduction.


Before the advent of the stressed-skin
structure for aircraft, or during the period
when fuselage and wing were fabric covered,
round, oval and square tubing were used in
designing the major structure of the fuselage
and wing. If the wing and tail were externally
braced, streamline tubing was used. The
development of the metal covered structure
eliminated the use of tubing in fuselage and
wing design, however, tUbing continued to be
used for landing gear structure, engine mounts,
control systems, fixed equipment such as
passenger seats, etc.


With the opening of the space age, tUbing
as a structural unit in space vehicles is
again being widely used because drag in space
is not an important factor. Round tubing is
the best shape for transmitting torsional
forces and thus is widely used in control
systems. Round and square tUbing permit simple
connection or end fitting design. The metals
industry has made available a large number of
diameter and wall thicknesses and thus the
structural designer has a large number of sizes
to select from.


C4. 2 Design for Tension.


In general the strength design requirements are that the limit loads must be carried
without exceeding the tensile yield stress
(Fty) of the material and the ultimate design
load which is equal to the limit load times a
factor of safety must be carried without
failure, which means the tensile stress cannot
exceed the (Ftu) of the material. In general
for aircraft, the factor of safety is 1.5.
For unmanned missiles and space vehicles the
factor of safety may be as low as 1.2. Since
the ratio of Ftu to Fty for materials varies
widely, sometimes the yield under limit loads
is more critical than failure under the
ultimate design loads, thus the student should
always be sure he has the critical situation.


Since elevated temperature and time of
exposure effect the yield and ultimate strength
of materials, the problem of material selection
relative to light weight becomes an important
design factor. Fig. C4.1 shows a plot of the
Ftu/w ratio versus elevated temperatures up
to 800 degrees, where w is the density of the
material. The tube materials are AISI alloy


C4.1



steel and 2024 aluminum alloy. Observation of
Fig. C4.1 shows that for temperatures below
350 [o] F, a1Qminum alloy is lighter unless the
steel is heat-treated to Ftu = 180,000 or
above. Above 350 [o] F, the ultimate strength of
aluminum alloy falls off rapidly, but steel
continues its rather uniform decrease in
tensile strength.


The graph explains why aluminum alloy
cannot be used entirely for the surface of
supersonic airplanes flying at speeds around
2000 miles per hour, as aerodynamic heating
would produce surface temperatures in the
region where the strength of aluminum alloy
decreases rapidly.

Practically every structural tubular
member in a flight vehicle structure must be
fastened or attached to another adjacent
member. The connection can be made by using
some sort of end fitting which is fastened to
the tube by rivets or bolts or by welding. If
rivets or bolts are used, holes are cut in the
tube walls which means the tube is weakened
since tube area is cut away, thus net area on
any tube cross-section must be used in calculating the tube tensile strength. If welding
is used in the connection, the welding heat
causes grain growth in the tube material
adjacent to the weld area, which decreases the
tube strength, thus a welding correction factor
must be used in calculating the ultimate tensile
strength. Designing for tension will be
illustrated later in this chapter.

C4. 3 Design for Compression.


The strength of members With stable crosssections when acting as columns can be calculated by Euler's equation if the bending
failure is elastic, or E is constant (eq. C4.1)
and for inelastic bending failure, Euler's
equation With the tangent modulus Et replacing
E (eq. C4.2) checks test reSUlts. (The stUdent
should refer to Chapters A18 and C2 for theory
on column strength.)

L' is the effective length and equals
L/~ where c is the column end fixity
coefficient.


Long and Short Columns


For many years the problem or subject of
inelastic column strength or failure was
treated almost entirely from a consideration
of test results. That is, sufficient tests
were made to establish the shape of the failing
stress curve in the region where the failure
was at stresses above the proportional limit
stress of the material. Mathematical curves
were then derived to fit the test results.
Engineers referred to the columns which failed
by inelastic bending as short columns, and
thus referred to the equations that fit the
test data as short column equations. The
columns that failed by elastic bending were
then referred to as long columns. The test
curve for long columns would follow the Euler
column equation (C4.l) and thus tests were
not necessary to establish allowable failing
stresses in the so-called long column range.
Thus over the years short column equations
based on test results have been presented by
official government agencies for use in
structural design. The official publication
for the aerospace field is the Military
Handbook MIL-HDBK (Ref. 1).


C4. 4 Column Formulas for Round Steel Tubes.


From (Ref. 1) the basic short column
equations are:

Fc = Fco [l-F co (V/p)lil/4n [lil] EJ - - - - - (C4.3)


Fc = Fco { 1- 0.3027 [(L' /p )/n

_J_ _E/F_ _co_ J 1.0 IS}      - - - (C4.4)


Where Fco is the column yield stress
(upper limit of column stress for primary
failure). It can be determined from test
reSUlts by extending the short column curve to
a point corresponding to zero length, ignoring



The equations for determining Fco are
given in Table C4.2 (from Ref. 1). The table
also indicates which of the three short column
equations to use for the various aluminum alloy
materials.


To illustrate the use of Table C4.2, the
column formula for 2024-T3 aluminum alloy
tubing will be derived:

From Chapter B2, we find the following
strength properties for 2024-T3 tubing,


F tu = 64000, F cy = 42000


From Table C4.2, the equation for Fco is,


Fco = F cy (1 + ..; Fcy/lOOO SUbstituting,


Fco = 42000 (1 + ..; 42/1000 = 42000 (1 + .205)

= 50600

From Table C4.2, we note that short
column equation C4.5 applies.


SUbstituting in this equation,


Fc = 50600 [1 - 0.385(L' /p/n"; 10,500,000/50600]


or Fc = 50600 - 431 L'/p - - - - - - - - (C4.9)


C4. 6 Column Formulas for Magnesium Alloys.

From (Ref. 1) the following short column
equations for various magnesium alloy materials



any tendency of the test curve to rise rapidly
for very short lengths where failure is by
block compression. Table C4.l shows the
reSUlting short and long column equations
after values of Fco and E have been SUbstituted
in equations C4.3 and C4.4 and E in the Euler
equation. The column headed transitional
L' /p, represents the value of L' /p where failure
change from inelastic to elastic failure or, in
other words, it is the dividing point between
the so-called long and short column range.
Thus if the equations are used, the L'/p value
must be known in order to select the proper
equation.


C4. 5 Column Formulas for Aluminum Alloy Tubes.


From (Ref. 1), the basic short column
equations for aluminum alloys are:


F C - Fco [1 - 0.385 (L' /p)/n) E/FcoJ


Fc = Fco [1 0.333 (L'/p)/nv E/FcoJ


Fc - Fco [1 - 0.272 (L'/p)/n"; E/Fco ]


For long columns:

Fc = [n] [lil] [E/(L'/p)2] **-------**

C4. 7 Short Column Equations for Other Materials.


For other metals for which short column
equations are not available, the use of Euler's
equation, using the tangent modulus Et can be
used (eq. C4.2). Refer to Chapter C2 for
information on how to construct column strength
curves using this equation.


C4. 8 Column Failure Due to Local Failure.


The equations as presented give the
allowable stress due to failure by bending of
the column as a whole and the action is elastic



d Not necessary to investigate for local instability when

D/t<: 50.
e This value is applicable when the material is furnished
in condition N (MIL-T-6736) but the yield strength is
reduced when normalized subsequent to welding to 60
ksi.


or inelastic instability of the column as a
whole. As the slenderness ratio L'/p gets
smaller, the Fc stress increases. Now if the
diameter of the tube is relatively large and
the wall thickness relatively small or, in
other words, if the diameter/thickness (D/t)
ratio is large, failure will result by local
crippling or crushing of the tube wall and
this local failing stress is usually represented by the symbol Fcc. The values of Fcc
in general have been determined by tests (see
design charts for Fcc versus D/t ratio).


C4. 9 Design Column Charts .


In design, column strength charts are a
great time-saver as compared to SUbstituting
in the various column equations, thus a number
of column charts are presented in this chapter
to facilitate the strength check of columns
and the strength design of columns. Fig.
C4.2 is a chart of L'/p versus Fc for heat
treated round alloy steel tubing. Fig. C4.3
is a similar type of chart for aluminum alloy
round tubing. Fig. C4.4 gives column charts
for magnesium alloy materials. All three
charts are taken from (Ref. 1). Figs. C4.5
and C4.6 represent a further simplication for
the design of steel and aluminum round tubing.


C4. 10 Section Properties of Round Tubing.


Table C4.3 gives the section properties
of round tUbing. A tube is designated by
giving its outside wall diameter (D) and its
wall thickness (t). Thus a 2-1/4 - .058 means
a tube with 2-1/4 inch outside diameter and a
wall thickness in inches of .058. Since a tUbe
is symmetrical about any axis, the polar moment
of inertia, which is needed in torsion problems,
equals twice the rectangular moment of inertia
as given in Table C4.3. For weight comparison,
the weight of steel and aluminum tubing is

For a given area, the larger the tube
diameter, the greater the column strength
if failure due to local crippling is not
critical.


The higher the D/t ratio of tube the lower
the crippling or local failure strength.


If columns fall within the long column
category, the use of higher strength alloy
steel or aluminum alloy will not increase
strength of column since E is practically
constant for all chrome-moly steel alloys
and likewise for all aluminum alloys.
Failure is due to elastic buckling of the
column as a whole and is therefore a
function only of I, L' and E.

4. The column end restraint affects the necessary tube size. Consult the design requirements of the Army, Navy, and C.A.A. in this
matter. In general with welded steel
tubular trusses a coefficient of C = 2 is
permissible except for engine mount and
Nacelle structures. For trusses with
riveted joints a value of not over 1 5 is
generally permissible.


5. The student should realize that practical
limitations such as clearance requirements
may determine the diameter of the tube
instead of strength-weight considerations.
Thus design can consist of checking the
tubes available under the given
restrictions.


C4. 12 Effect of Welding of steel Tubes Upon the Tension
and Column Strength.


Since welding affects the grain structure
of the tube material adjacent to the weld,
tests show the strength of the material
adjacent to the weld is decreased as compared
to the unwelded material. If a tapered weld
is used, the effect of the weld is decreased.
Table C4.5 shows the allowable stresses in
tension to use when tension loads are carried.


In short columns, the primary column
failing stress may be greater than the local
crippling strength of the tube adjacent to
the weld at the end of the tube. This local
failing stress due to welding is referred to
as the weld cut-off stress and the column
compressive stress Fc should not exceed this
value. This cut-off weld stress is shown by
the horizontal lines in Fig. C4.2 and C4.5.




 - Note: Gussets or plate inserts considered 00 "taper"
with ~ .


** For (X-4130) Special, comparable, values to the Ftu,
equal to 90, 000 and 80, 000, are stresses 94, 500 and
84, 100 psi, respectively.

C4. 13 lllustrative Problems in Strength t;:hecking

and Design of Round Steel Tubes as Columns
and Tension Members.


PROBLEM 1


Tube size = 1-1/2    - .058, Length L = 30 in
End fixity coefficient C = 1.
Material:- Alloy steel, Ftu = 95000. The
tube is welded at ends.
Ultimate design loads are:- P = -14,500
lbs. compression, and P = 18500 lbs. tension.
Required the Margin of Safety (M.S.)


Solution: The compressive (M.S.) will be
determined first. As the simplest solution,
we can use the column curves in Fig. C4.5.
For a length of 30 and C = 1, from the upper
right chart we project upward to the intersection with the 1-1/2 diameter tube and then
horizontally to the left hand scale to read
the column strength of 14800 lbs. which we
will call the allowable failing Pa.


11.. M S = Pa _ 1P = 14800 _ 114500 =    - 02


The tube strength could also be found by
using Fig. C4.2 as follows:


L' = L/Y-C- = 30/y-r- = 30


L'/p = 30/.5102 = 58.7. P is found from
Table C4.3 as well as the tube area 0.2628
sq. in. Using 58.7 for L'/p on lower scale
and projecting upward to the Ftu = 95000
curve, which is the lower curve, and then
horizontally to left hand scale we read
Fc = 56500 psi.


Whence, Pa = FcA = 56500 x .2628 =
14850 lb.


The solution obViously could be made by
SUbstituting in the short column equation for
steel having Ftu = 95000, or

STRENGTH & DESIGN OF ROUND, STREAMLINE, OVAL AND SQUARE TUBING
C4.10 ~~IN TENSION~~ ~~COMPRESSION~~ ~~BENDING TORSION AND COMBINED LOADINGS~~



Fe = 79500 - 51.9 {L' /p)~'~


= 79500 - 51.9 {58.7)~·~ = 56500 psi


The short column equation applies since,
as shown in Table C4.1, the transitional L'/p
is 91 and the value for our tube is 58.7.


Tensile Strength


Since the tube is welded, the tUbe
material adjacent to the weld is weakened.
The weld correction values are given in Table
C4.5. We will assume a weld other than
tapered. Let Pa ~ allowable or failing tensile
strength of tube.


Pa = Ftu (weld factor) (area of tUbe)

= 95000 x .841 x .2628 = 21000 Ibs.


M.S. = {Pa/p)-l = (21000/18500) - 1 =
0.13, thus compression is critical.


PROBLEM 2


Case 1. Tube size 1-1/4 - .049, L = 40 in.
c = 1
Material: Alloy steel, Ftu = 95000
Find ultimate compressive load it will
carry.


Solution: From Fig. C4.5, Pa = 6000 Ibs.


Case 2. If tube was heat treated to Ftu =
150,000, what compressive load would
it carry.


Solution: Fig. C4.5 cannot be used since
Ftu = 150,000, thus we will use Fig. C4.2.

L' = L/...;G = _40/VT_ = 4. From Table C4.3,
p = .425 and area (A) = .1849.


L'/p = 40/.425 = 94. From Fig. C4.2,
using the 150,000 curve, we find Fc = 32500.
Then Pa = FcA = 32500 x .1849 = 6000 lb. Thus
heat treating the tUbe from 95000 to 150,000
for Ftu did not increase the column strength.
For a L'/p = 94, it is a long column and
failure is elastic and E is constant.


The strength could also be calculated by
Euler's equation from Table C4.I.


Fc = 286,000,000/{L'/p)2

= 286,000,000/(94)2 = 32500 psi, the
same as previously calculated.-----

Case 3. Same as Case 1, but assume tube is
welded to several other tUbes at its
end and that the end fixity developed
is c = 2.



L' = L/...;G = 40/v'2: = 28.4


In Fig. C4.5 we can use L = 40 and c = 2
scale at bottom of chart or use c = 1 scale
and L' = 28.4. Reading the chart we obtain
Pa = 9200 Ibs. Thus the c = 2 fixity
increased the strength of the tube from 6000
to 9200.


Case 4. Same as Case 3 but heat treated to
Ftu = 150,000 after welding.


L'/p = 28.4/.425 = 66.8


From Fig. C4.2 using 150,000 curve, we
read Fc = 63000, whence


Pa = FcA = 63000 x .1849 = 11650 lb.


In this case heat treating produced
additional strength, whereas in Case 2 it did
not. The reason for this is that failure
occurs in the inelastic stress range and heat
treating raises the material propertiBs in the
inelastic range. The end fixity changed the
column from a so-called long column to a short
column.


The strength could be found also by substituting in the short column equal for
150,000 steel as given in Table C4.1,


Fc = 145000 - 18.36 {L'/p)2

= 145000 - 18.36 {66.8)2 = 63000 psi.


PROBLEM 3


Case 1. Tube size 2 - .065, L = 24, c = 1.5
Material Ftu = 95000. Welded at ends.
Ultimate design load = 25000 Ibs.
What is M.S.


Solution: L' = L/ve : 24/~ = 19.7


From Fig. C4.5 for L = 19.7 on c = 1
scale, we project upward to the 2 inch tube
and note that it intersects the horizontal
weld cut-off line which gives an allowable
column load at left scale of P a = 26700 lb.
Failure in this case is local crippling
adjacent to welds at the tube ends.


M.S. = Pa/ p = 26700/25000 - 1 = .07


Case 2. Assume tUbe is heat treated to Ftu
= 125000 after welding. What is tube
strength.


L'/p = 19.7/.6845 = 28.8


Using Fig. C4.2 With L'/p = 28.8 and projecting up to 125000 curve, we again note that
horizontal weld cut-off line is intersected


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-651-full.png)

giving Fc = 95000, whence Pa = 95000 x .3951
= 37500 Ibs.


If the tube had not been welded at ends
the dashed part of the column curve could have
been used, thus giving additional strength.


PROBLEM 4


Fig. C4.7 shows a steel tubular,engine
mount structure for a 1050 H.P. radial engine.
The ultimate design tension and compressive
load in each member as determined from a stress
analysis for the various flying and landing
conditions are shown in ( ) adjacent to each
member. The true length L of each member is
also shown. Using chrome-moly steel tUbes,
Ftu = 95000, select tube sizes for the given
loads. It is common practice to assume the
column end fixity c = 1 for engine mount
members, since the mount is subjected to
considerable vibration and the true rigidity
given by the engine mount ring is difficult
to accurately determine.

The results show that 1-1/4   - .035 is the
lightest. Since there is danger in welding
.035 thickness to the other heavier tube gauges
particularly the engine mount ring which is
usually relatively heavy for this size engine,
a minimum tUbe thickness of .049 will be used,
hence the 1-1/8 - .049 tube will be selected.


Consider Member (2)


Design loads 11650 tension and 4250
compression. Since the tension load appears
critical, the tube will be designed for the
tension load and then checked for the
compressive load. The Ftu of the material
equals 95000 psi. Since the engine mount in a
welded structure, the strength of the tube adjacent to the end welds must be reduced to .841
x 95000 = 80000 psi (see Table C4.5).


Hence tube area required = 11650/80000 =
0.146 sq, in. From Table C4.3, which gives
the section properties of round tUbes, we
select the following sizes:


1- .049, Area = .146, M.S. = ( .146/ .146) - 1 = 0

1- .058, Area = .172, M.S. = ( .172/ .146) - 1 = .19

1-1/8 .049, Area = •166, M.S - = .14


1-3/8 - 035, Area = .147, M.S . = 0


To obtain a reasonable margin of safety, the
1-1/8 - .049 will be selected.


Many structural designers prefer to have
large margins of safety on engine mount members
as conSiderable trouble has been encountered in
the failure or cracking of engine mount members.

Consider member (3). Ultimate design load =

Fig. C4.5, we find for C = 1 and L = 31.4 the
following tube sizes for a strength near

In general alloy steel round tubes must
be heat treated to around 180,000 to 200,000
ultimate tension strength before they can compare favorably with aluminum round tubes on a
material weight basis. However, aluminum
alloy as used for tubes cannot be welded
satisfactorily and thus in a truss structure
the end connections involving riveted and
bolted connections add weight and design
difficulties as compared to welded connections
in steel trusses.

PROBLEM 1



STRENGTH & DESIGN OF ROUND, STREAMLINE, OVAL AND SQUARE TUBING
IN TENSION, COMPRESSION, BENDING, TORSION AND COMBINED LOADINGS.


C4.15 Strength of Streamline Tubing.



Case 1. Tube size 1 - .049 round.
L = 24, c = 1, Material 2024-T3
Find failing compressive load.


Solution: The col1nnn curves in Fig. C4.6 are
slightly conservative because the equation used
was slightly different from the equCLtion now
specified in (Ref. 1).


Use L = 24, we read for 1-049 tube a
failing load of 2800 lb.


As a second solution, we will use Fig.
C4.3. L' = L/y'C: = 24/v-r- = 24. L'/P =
24/.3367 = 71.3. From Fig. C4.3, we read
Fe = 20000. Then Pa = FcA = 20000 x .1464 =
2930 lb.


The answer could be obtained by substitilting in equation C4.9,



If a round tube is exposed to the airstream, the air drag is about 15 times greater
than if it were given a streamlined shape, thus
streamline tubes are used when the member is
exposed to the airstream.


Streamline tubes are drawn from round
tubes. In designating a streamline tUbe, the
round tube from which it was made is used and
then the fineness ratio is also given. The
fineness ratio is the ratio L/D, which dimensions are shown in Fig. C4.8. The most common
fineness ratio used is 2.5 to 1. Table C4.6
shows the section properties of streamline
tubing haVing a fineness ratio of 2.5 to 1.
Figs. C4.9 and C4.10 give curves for finding
the column failing stress Fe and the local
crushing stress Fcc.


Fig. C4.8



![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-652-0.png)

Fe = 50600 431 L'/p B = . 944L R = . 19D

d = Equiv. Round Dia.

Pa 19900 x .1464 = 2920 lb.



A column may also fail by local crushing
or crippling of the tube wall, thLlS the
crushing stress Fcc should be determined to
see if it is less than the primary bending
failing stress for the column.


For our tube the diameter over thickness

ratio D/t = LO/ .0'19 = 20.40. Values of D/t
are given in Table C4.3.


Referring to the small chart in the u~per
right hand corner of Fig. C4.3, we find for a
D/t of 20.4 that Fcc = 47500 psi. Since this
stress is greater than the bending failing
column stress of 20,000, it is not criticaL


Case 2. Same as Case 1 but use c = 1.5 and


chan~e material to 6061-T6 alwninum
alloy.


L' = L/V-C:= 24/~ = 19.7, L'/p = 19.7/.3367


From Fig. C4.3, Fe = 22500


Whence Pa = 22500 x .1464 = 3300 lb.


Fcc for D/t = 20.4 from Fig. C4.3 = 38500 (not
critical) .


Case 3. Same as Case 2 but change material to
magnesium alloy, F cy = 10,000.


For L'/p = 58.5 and using lower curve on
Fig. C4.4, we read Fc = 7600. Then Pa = FcA =
7600 x .1464 = 1110 lb.



C4. 16 Strength of Oval and Square Shaped Tubes
in Compression.


Tables C4.8 and C4.7 give the section
properties for square and oval shaped tubes
respectively. For the design of these shaped



PROBLEM 1. Case 1.


A streamline tube made from a basic round

tUbe of 2-1/2 - .065 size has a fineness ratio
of 2.5 to 1. The length L is 30 in. Take
c = 1. Material is alloy steel Fty = 75000.
Find the ultimate compressive load the member
will carry.


Solution: From Table C4.6 for 2-1/2 - .065
size we find the follOWing section properties:Area (A) = .4972, P (major axis) = .5137 in.
Then L' = L/V-C- = 30/v-r- = 30, and L'/p =
30/.5137 = 58.5

D/t value for tube = 2.5/.065 = 38.5


From Fig. C4.9 for L'/p = 58.5 and D/t =
38.5, we read Fe = 46500 psi. For D/t = 38.5
and reading from small chart in upper right
hand corner of Fig. C4.9, we read Fcc = 66500.
Thus Fc is critical and Pa = 46500 x .4972 =
23000 lb.


Case 2. Same as Case 1 but change material
to 2024-T6 aluminum alloy.



For this material we use
For L'/p = 58.5, we read Fc
For D/t = 38.5, we read Fcc =
critical). Thus P a = 26000 x

tubes the primary column strength can be found
by using the curves in Figs. C4.9 and C4.10.
The crushing stress Fcc for oval shaped tubes
can conservatively be taken as that for
streamline tubes as given in Figs. C4.9 and
C4.10. For square tubes the local crushing
stress Fcc can be taken as the crippling stress
of a flat plate. For this stress refer to the
chapter which covers the buckling and crippling
stress of flat plates with various widths,
thickness and boundary edge conditions.


ULTIMATE BENDING STRENGTH

OF ROUND TUBES


C4. 17 Charts for Finding Modulus of Rupture Stress.


Chapter C3 was concerned with the theory
and methods of determining the ultimate yield
and failing stress of a section in pure
bending. It was concerned with finding a
fictitious stress Fb which, when substituted
in the well known beam formula M = FbI/c, would
give the value of the bending moment which
would cause failure.

6A1-4V tubing. (Titanium)



C4.15


C4. 18 Problems InvolVing Bending Strength of Tubes.


PROBLEM 1


A 1-1/4  - .058 round tube is used as a
simply supported beam with the supports at the
ends. The span or length of the beam is 24
inches. It carries a uniform distributed load
w in pounds per inch. Find the value of w to
cause the tube to fail in bending if the tube
is made from the following materials:- alloy
steel Ftu = 95000, 6061-T6 aluminum alloy, and
6AL-4V titanium.


Solution: The maximum bending moment occurs
at the midpoint of the span and equals wL 2 /8 =
w x 24 2 /8 = 72 w in. lb.


The section properties for the tube are
D/t = 21.55, and I/y = .06187 obtained from
Table C4.3.


The beam equation involving the modulus
of rupture Fb is M = FbI/y. SUbstituting 72w
for M, we obtain:


FbI

w = 72y


Consider the alloy steel, Ftu = 95000. From
Fig. C4.11 for D/t = 21.55, we read Fb =
117000. Then w = (117000 x .06187)/72 = 100.2
lb. per inch. Consider tube material as ----6061-T6 which has a Ftu = 42000 psi.


From Fig. C4.12 for D/t = 21.55, we read
that Ft/Ftu = l.06. Thus Fb = 42000 x l.06 =
44500.


Then w = (44500 x .06187)/72 = 38.1.
Tube material 6AL-4V titanium. ---

From Fig. C4.14 for D/t = 21.55, we read
Fb = 191600. Then w = (191600 x .06187)/72 =
118.7 Ibs. per in.


PROBLEM 2


A beam simply supported at its ends has
a span of 30 inches. The ultimate design load
consists of two equal loads of 2000 Ibs. each.
The beam is symmetrically loaded with each
load located 12 inches from the ends.


Select the lightest round tUbe when made
from the following material: (1) alloy steel
Ftu = 220000, (2) 7075-T6 aluminum alloy.
Compare the resulting tube weights.


Solution: The maximum bending moment is
constant and occurs between the load points.


M = 2000 x 12 = 24000 in. lb.

Fig. C4. 13 Bending modulus of rupture of magnesium-alloy round tubing.


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-657-full.png)

Since the allowable or failing bending
stress is a function of D/t, and since we do
not have a tube size, the design or solution
procedure is by trial and error.


Observation of the modulus of rupture
curves show that as D/t increases Fb decreases.
This is due to the fact that failure in bending
is a local failure and the thinner the wall and
larger the diameter, the lower the buckling or
crushing stress. However, the larger the D/t
value the greater the section modulus I/y of
the tUbe, which means increasing bending
resistance. Thus we have two influences which
act oppositely relative to effecting the bending
strength.


There are many ways of guessing a tube
size for checking purposes. In this example
problem we will assume two values for D/t and
see what I/y would calculate to be. The two
values of D/t will be 45 and 25.


Consider the material alloy steel Ftu=220000:
For D/t = 45 from Fig.C4.11, Fb=232000


Then I/y = M/Fb = 24000/232000 = .103


For D/t = 25, Fb = 266000

Then I/y = 24000/266000 = .089


Therefore we will refer to Table C4.3 and
select tubes that have an I/y value near the

- 089 to .103 range and then find their true
bending strength. Table (A) shows the
selection and the necessary calculations,
using Fig. C4.11.



C4.17


Therefore we will select a tube from Table
C4.3 that has a I/y value in the region of .30
to .37.


Try 2-3/4   - 058. I/y = .3233, D/t = 47.4.
From Fig. C4.12, Fb/Ftu = 0.90. Then Fb = .90
x 77000 = 69300 psi. Then Ma = Fb I/y = 69300
x .3233 = 22400. This is less than the design
bending moment of 24000 so this tube is weak.


Try 3-058. I/y = .3868, D/t = 51.7
Fb/Ftu = .885, Fb = .885 x 77000 = 68000
Ma = Fb I/y = 68000 x .3868 = 26300
M.S. = (26300/24000)-1 = .09.


A study of other tubes in Table C4.3
shows that no other tube would be lighter in
weight.


Tube weight = 30 x .5361 x .101 = 1.70
lbs., as against 2.22 lbs. for the alloy steel
heat treated to 220,000. Thus aluminum alloy
tubes from a weight standpoint usually yield
results better than most materials. This
conclusion applies to only low temperatures,
below 250 [0] F, as aluminum alloys lose strength
rapidly for temperatures above 250 [0] to 300 [0] F.


The student should calculate the lightest
titanium tube and the lightest magnesium tube
using Figs. C4.14 and C4.13 respectively and
compare the weight results with the steel and
aluminum as found above •

The lightest available tube with a
positive margin of safety is 1-3/4 - .049 and
its weight for a 30 inch length is 30 x .2618
x 0.283 = 2.22 lbs.


Consider the tube made from 7075-T6 aluminum
alloy material which has a Ftu = 77000.


From Fig. C4.12:

For D/t = 60, Fb/Ftu = .84, thus Fb = .84 x
77000 = 64700

I/y = M/Fb = 24000/64700 = .37


For D/t = 30, Fb/Ftu = 1.045, thus Fb = 1.045 x
77000 = 80500

I/y = 24000/80500 = .30



In Article A6.2 of Chapter A6, the torsion
formula for circular sections, f s = Tr/J, was
derived. This equation assumes the maximum
shear stress on the cross-section of a round
bar or tube does not exceed the proportional
limit of the material, or the stress variation
is linear as shown in Fig. C4.15 and this
situation exists under the flight vehicle limit
loads. Before a round bar made of ductile

material fails in torsion, the shear stresses
fall in the inelastic or plastic range and

thus the internal shear stress distribution is
similar to that indicated in Fig. C4.16. The
shear stress-strain curve is similar in shape
to the tension stress-strain curve.and is
equal to approximately 0.6 of the ordinates.
Thus to find the ultimate internal torsional
resisting moment, we can divide the crosssection into a number of circular elements.
From the stress curve in Fig. C4.16, the stress
at the midpoints of the circular elements can
be found. Multiplying the area of the element
by this stress times the distance of the
element from the center axis gives the moment
developed, and adding up the moment of the
shear force on all the circular elements gives
the total allowable or ultimate internal
resisting moment Ta.


If this moment Ta is to be used in the
torsion equation, we must replace the true
stress curve in Fig. C4.16 by a triangular
stress curve With maximum value Fst which will
produce the same internal resisting moment as
the true stress curve. Thus


Ta = Fst J/r, or Fst = Ta r/J - - - - (C4.10)


Fst is called the torsional modulus of
rupture stress. It is a fictitious stress,
being higher than the ultimate shear stress
of the material. TUbes SUbjected to torsion
usually fail by inelastic or plastic instability
or by elastic instability if the D/t ratio is
large. To obtain reliable values of Fst,
resort is usually made to tests, and since the
round tUbe or rod is the most efficient and
most available shape, much testing has been
done over the years thus design curves are
readily available for round tubes of the most
common flight vehicle materials.


C4. 20 Torsional Modulus of Rupture Curves.


Figs. C4.17 to C4.24 inclusive present
curves for finding the modulus of rupture
stress Fst for steel alloys from Ftu = 95000
to 260,000 psi. It should be noted that the
torsional strength is influenced by the D/t
and the L/D values of the tube. Figs. C4.25
to C4.30 inclusive give curves for the various
aluminum alloys and Fig. C4.31 gives information for one magnesium alloy. All of these
curves were taken from (Ref. 1).


The curves are based on a theoretical
investigation by Lee and Ades (see Ref. 2),
and have been found to be in good agreement
with experimental results.

will it develop if made of the following
materials: (1) alloy steel Ftu = 95000,
(2) aluminum alloy 2024-T3.


Solution: D/t = 25. J/r = 2(I/y) = 2 x
0.11948 - 0.2390. L/D = 16.25/1.625 = 10.
For alloy steel, Ftu = 95000, we use Fig.
C4.17 where for D/t = 25 and L/D = 10, we read
Fst/lOOO = 47.3. Thus Fst = 47300.


Ta = Fst J/r = 47300 x 0.2390 = 11300 in. lb.


For 2024-T3 aluminum alloy, we refer to Fig.
C4.26 where we read Fst = 29000.


Then Ta = Fst J/r = 29000 x 0.2390 =
6930 in. lb.


Problem 2.


A round tube 10 inches long is to carry
an Ultimate torsional moment of 7000 in. lb.
Select the lightest tube if made from aluminum
alloy 2024-T4 and alloy steel Ftu = 200,000
and compare the resulting weight of each.


Solution: Since the modulus of rupture
depends on D/t and L/D and since the tube size
is unknown, we will use the trial and check
approach. The design calculations can conveniently be made in table form as follows:


Trial Tube Area D/t J/r L/D Fst Ta -_ M.S. Ta =
Size Fst [J] / [r] 1'-1

The lightest aluminum tUbe with a positive
margin of safety is 2 - .049. The weight of a

Although the steel is heat treated to Ftu =

alloy tube.

C4.22 Combined Bending & Compression.


In tUbes subjected to combined bending
and compression, the stress due to compression
is uniform over the cross-section whereas the
bending stress is not uniform over the crosssection. The following stress ratio equation
is possibly somewhat conservative but is
recommended by (Ref. 1).

The student should notice that the maximQ~
bending moment of 2490 in. lb. is 24 percent
greater than the primary moment which equals
wL [2] /8 = 10 x 40 [2] /8 = 2000. The lateral deflection at the midpoint of the tube thus equals
490/400 = 1.22 inch.


The secondary moments due to lateral deflection do not vary linearly, so if design
loads were increased the calculation of the
maximum bending should be repeated instead of

assu~ing that the moment would increase directly
as the applied load to the beam.

ILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEM 1


A 1-1/2   - .• 058 round steel tube (Ftu =
125000) is 30 inches long. It is subjected to
an ultimate design bending moment of 10,000
in. Ibs. and a torsional moment of 6000 in.
Ibs. Find the Margin of Safety.


Solution: D/t = 25.85, I/y = .0912, L/D = 20


To find Fb, we refer to Fig. C4.11 where
for D/t = 25.85 and Ftu = 125000 we read
Fb = 148000. Then Ma = FbI/y = 148000 x .0912
= 13500 in. lb.


M 10000
Then Rb = Ma = 13500 = .74


To find Fst, we refer to Fig. C4.18 where
for D/t = 25.85 and L/D = 20 we read Fst/1000
to be 61, whence Fst = 61000.

thus the ultimate strength of the tube has 9
percent Margin of Safety under the combined
loading.


In a design problem which involves a trial
and error procedure, using an equivalent
torsional moment Te which will produce the
same torsional stress as produced by the
combined bending and torsional loads is quite
useful in shortening the trial and error
procedure.



Having the value of Te, select tube sizes
that will develop this torsional moment Te as
was done in Problem 2 of Art. C4.21. These
sizes are then checked for combined bending and
torsion as illustrated above in the example
problem.


C4.24a Ultimate Strength in Combined Compression,
Bending and Torsion.


The interaction equation for combined
compression, bending and torsion from (Ref. 1)
is,


Figs. C4.36 and 37 show a plot of this
equation. The expression for the Margin of
Safety is,

M.S. = ----;:::::::;:==::::;::: - 1 - - - - - (C4.23)
Rc + _J_ R~, + R~t


To illustrate the use of the interaction
curves, let us assume the following values for
the three stress ratios: 

Rc = .333, Rb = .20, Rst = .20


Then Rst/R c = .20/.333 = .60.


In Fig. C4.36 locate point (a) at the
Intersection of Rc = .333 and Rb = .20. Since
the intersection point (a) lies inside the
Rst/R c = .60 curve, we know that a positive
margin of safety exists. A line is now drawn
through (0) and (a) and extended to an intersection with the Rst/R c = .60 curve at point
(b). Projecting vertically downward to Rc
scale, we read Rc = .538. Then M.S. = (.538/
.333) - 1 = .62.

C5. 1 Introduction.


Chapter A18, Part 2, introduced the
student to the theoretical approach to the
problem of determining the buckling equation
for flat sheet in compression with various
edge or boundary conditions. A similar
theoretical approach has been made for other
load systems, such as shear and bending, thus
the buckling equations for flat sheet have
been available for many years. This chapter
will summarize these equations and provide
design charts for practical use in designing
sheet and plate structures. Most of the

NACA Technical Note 378l-Part I, "Buckling of

C5.2 Equation for Elastic Buckling Strength of
Flat Sheet in Compression.


From Chapter A18, the equation for the
elastic instauility of flat sheet in compression
is,
2
n k C E t
Ocr = ----- ( [_)2]   - - - - - - (C5.l)
_12_ (l-ZJ~) b


Where kc = buckling coefficient which depends
on edge boundary conditions and
sheet aspect ratio (alb)


E = modulus of elasticity

_V_ _e_ = elastic Poisson's ratio


b = short dimension of plate or loaded
edge


t = sheet thickness


C5. 3 Buckling Coefficient kc


Fig. C5.l shows the change in buckled
shape as the boundary conditions are changed
on the unloaded edges from free to restrained.


In Fig. (a) the sides are free, thus sheet
acts as a column. In Fig. (b) one side is
restrained and the other side free, and such a
restrained sheet is referred to as a flange.
In Fig. (c) both sides are restrained and this
restrained element is referred to as a plate.

hinged. Fig. C5.3 shows curves for kc for
various degrees of restraint (E) along the
sides of the sheet panel, where E is the ratio
of rotational rigidity of the plate edge
stiffener to the rotational rigidity of the
plate.

flange that has one edge free and the other

C5.5 illustrates where the compressive stress
varies linearly over the length of the Sheet,
a typical case being the sheet panels on the
upper side of a cantilever wing under normal
flight condition. .

This stress is below the proportional
limit stress for the material, thus equation
C5.l applies and needs no plasticity correction.


C5.4 Equation for Inelastic Buckling Strength of Flat Sheet
in Compression.


If the buckling or instability occurs at
a stress in the inelastic or plastic stress
range, then E and _V_ are not the same as for
elastic buckling, thus a plasticity correction
factor is required and equation C5.l is
written,

Ocr = '( n 11. [2] k c E (~)2 __ - - __ (C5.2)
_l2(1-V_ _e_ _2 )_ b


Where _T/_ is the plasticity reduction factor
and equals ocr plastiC/Ocr elastic.


The values of kc and _V_ _e_ are always the
elastic values since the coefficient ~ contains
all changes in those terms resulting from
inelastic behaVior.


A tremendous amount of theoretical and
experimental work has been done relative to
the value of the so-called plasticity correction factor. Possibly the first values
used by design engineers were _T/_ = Et/E or
_T/_ = Esec/E. Whatever the expression for _T/_ it
must involve a measure of the stiffness of the
material in the inelastic stress range and
since the stress-strain relation in the plastic
range is non-linear, a resort must be made to
the stress-strain curve to obtain a plasticity
correction factor. This complication is
greatly simplified by using the Ramberg and
Osgood equations for the stress-strain curve
which involves 3 simple parameters. (The
reader should refer to Chapter Bl for
information on the Ramberg-Osgood equations.)
Thus using the Ramber-Osgood parameters (Ref.l)
presents Figs. C5.7 and C5.8 for finding the
compressive buckling stress for flat sheet
panels with various boundary conditions for
both elastic and inelastic buckling or instability.


C5.5 Simple Problems to lllustrate Use of Curves in Figs.

Ocr



Solution: E = 10,700,000. _V_ _e_ = 0.3,
alb = 10/5 = 2. The boundary or edge condition
corresponds to Case (c) in Fig. C5.2. Thus
using curve (c) for alb = 2, we read kc = 4.0.

_V_ _e_ = 0.3. Find the buckling stress ocr.


Solution: We use Fig. C5.8 since it covers
the boundary conditions of our problem. The
parameter for bottom scale is,
k c n 2 E

                        -                        -                        -                        -                        -                        -                        - - (A)


For alb = _9/3_ = 3, we find kc from curve
(c) of Fig. C5.2 equals 4.0.


The use of Fig. C5.8 involves the use of
00.7 and n the Ramberg-Osgood parameters.
Referring to Table Bl.l of Chapter Bl, we find
for 2024-T3 aluminum alloy that 00.7 = 39000
and the shape factor n = 11.5.


Substituting in (A):

4.0 n [2 ] x 10,700,000 (.0~4)2 = .98
12 (1 - .3 [2] ) 39,000


From Fig. C5.8 using .98 on bottom scale
and n = 11.5 curve, we read on left hand scale
**that** **Ocr/crce?** **=** **.84.**


Then ocr = 39000 x .84 = 32800 psi.


If we heglected any plasticity effect, then
we would use equation C5.2 with ~ = 1.0, or,


2
ocr = n x4.0xlO,700,000 (.094)2 = 38400 psi
12 (1 _ .3 [2 ] ) 3


Whereas the actual buckling stress was 32800,
or in this case the plasticity correction
factor is _328/384_ = .854.


The sheet thickness used in this example
of .094 is relatively large. If we change the
sheet thickness to .051 inches the results
would be practically no correction within the
accuracy of reading the curves, and the buckling
stress ocr would calculate to be 11200 psi,
which is below the proportional limit stress
and thus no plasticity correction.



C5.5


Thus a further correction must be made for
alclad sheets because of the lower strength
clad covering material. Thus the buckling
stress for alclad sheets can be written:

Thus the buckling stress for alclad sheets is
determined for the primary strength properties

illustrated in the two previous example
problems. The resulting ocr is then reduced
by use of equation C5.3, using values of


~ from Table C5.1.

The critical elastic shear buckling stress
for flat plates with various boundary
conditions is given by the following equation:

7 cr = __ n" ' __ k S E (.!.-) " - - - - - - - (C5.4)
12 (1 _ _V_ _e ")_ b


Where (b) is always the shorter dimension of
the plate as all edges carry shear. ks is the
shear buckling coefficient and is plotted as a
function of the plate aspect ratio alb in Fig.
C5.11 for simply supported edges and clamped
edges.


If buckling occurs at a stress above the
proportional limit stress, a plasticity
correction must be included and equation C5.4
becomes


71 n" k E
7 cr = _-=-s __ -=-s __ (~) " - - - - - - - (C5.5)
12 (1    - _V_ _e_ ")


Test results compare favorably with the
results of equation C5.5 if 71s = Gs/G where G
is the shear modulus and Gs the shear secant
modulus as obtained from a shear stress-strain
diagram for the material.


A long rectangular plate subjected to
pure shear produces internal compressive
stresses on planes at 45 degrees with the
plate edges and thus these compressive stresses
cause the long panel to buckle in patterns at
an angle to the plate edges as illustrated in
Fig. C5.12, and the buckle patterns have a half
wave length of 1.25b.

similar to the chart in Figs. C5.7 and C5.8 in
that the values _00.7_ and n must be known for
the material before the chart can be used to
find the shear buckling stress.

Where kb is the buckling coefficient and
is obtained from Fig. C5.15 for various alb
ratios and edge restraint E against rotation.
In the alb ratio the loaded edge is (b).


The plasticity reduction factor can be
obtained from Fig. C5.8 using simply supported
edges.


BUCKLING OF FLAT SHEETS
UNDER COMBINED LOADS


The practical design case involving the
use of thin sheets usually involves a combined
load system, thus the calculation of the
buckling strength of flat sheets under combined stress systems is necessary. The
approach used involves the use of inter-action
equations or curves (see Chapter Cl, Art.
Cl.15 for explanation of inter-action
equations) 

_**C5.9**_ **Combined Bending and Longitudinal**
**Compression.**


The interaction equation that has been
widely used for combined bending and longi


The equation for bending instability of
flat plates in bending is the same as for
compression and shear except the buckling coefficient kb is different from kc or ks ' When
a plate in bending buckles, it involves
relatively short wave length buckles equal to
_2/3_ b for long plates with simply supported
edges (see Fig. C5.14). Thus the smaller
buckle patterns cause the buckling coefficient
kb to be larger than kc or ks '

The margin of safety of elastically
buckled flat panels may be determined from
Fig. C5.l9. The dashed lines indicate a
typical application where Rc = .161, Rs = .23,
and Rb = .38. Point 1 is first determined for
the specific value of Rs and Rb. The dashed
diagonal line from the origin 0 through point
1, intersecting the related Rc/Rs curve at
point 2, yields the allowable shear and bending
stresses for the desired margin of safety
calculations. (Note when Rc is less than Rs
use the right half of the figure; in other
cases use the left half).


C5. 13 Illustrative Problems.


In general a structural component composed of stiffened sheet panels will not fail
when buckling of the sheet panels occurs since
the stiffening units can usually continue to
carry more loading before they fail. However,
there are many design situations which require
that initial buckling of sheet panels satisfy
certain design specifications. For example,
the top skin on a low wing passenger airplane
should not buckle under accelerations due to
air gusts which occur in normal every day
flying thus preventing passengers from
observing wing skin buckling in normal flying
conditions. Another example would be that no
buckling of fuselage skin panels should occur
while airplane is on ground with full load
aboard in order to prevent public from
observing buckling of fuselage skin. In many
airplanes, fuel tanks are built integral with
the wing or fuselage, thus to eliminate the
chances of leakage developing, it is best to
design that no buckling of sheet panels that
bound the fuel tanks occur in flying and
landing conditions. In some cases aerodynamic
or rigidity requirements may dictate no
buckling of sheet panels. To insure that
buckling will not occur under certain load
requirements, it is good practice to be
conservative in selecting or calCUlating the
boundary restraints of the sheet panels.


Problem 1.


Fig. C5.20 shows a portion of a cantilever
wing composed of Sheet, stiffeners and ribs.
The problem is to determine whether skin panels
marked (A), (B) and (c) will buckle under the
various given load cases. The sheet material
is aluminum alloy 2024-T3.


Load Case 1.


P 1 = 700 lb., P 2 = 0, P 3 = 0


With only loads P 1 acting, the one cell
stiffened cantilever beam is subjected to a
compressive axial load of 2 x 700 = 1400 lb.
Since the P 1 loads are not acting through the



centroid of the cross-section,
is produced about the x-x axis
3.7 = 5170 in. lb. = Mx, where
from load P 1 to x-x axis.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-678-0.png)


Fig. C5.20



The sheet thicknesses, stiffener areas and
all necessary dimensions are shown on Fig.
C5.20. The total cross-sectional area of beam
section including all skin and stringers is
3.73 sq. in. The moment of inertia about x-x
4
centroidal axis calCUlates to be 49.30 in. 

Since the beam section is symmetrical,
the top panels A, Band C are SUbjected to the
same stress under the P 1 load system.


Compressive stress due to transferring
loads P 1 to centroid of beam cross-section is,


f c = 2P 1 /area = 1400/3.73 = 375 psi


Compressive stress due to constant bending
moment of 5170 in. lbs. is,


f = M Z/I = 5170 x 4.233/49.30 = 444 psi
c x x

Total f = 375 + 444 = 819 psi.

Since F ccr the buckling stress is greater
than the applied stress f c, the panels will
not buckle.


M.S. = (Fccr/f c ) - 1 = (1900/819) -1 = 1.32


Load case 2.


p~ = 700 lb., P2 = 500, P 3 = 0


The two loads P2 acting in opposite
directions produce a couple or a torsional
moment of 500 X 16.5 = 8250 in. lb. on the
beam structure, which means we have added a
pure shear stress system to the compressive
stress system of Case 1 loading.

Load Case 3.


P~ = 700, P2 = 500, P 3 = 100 lb.


The two loads P 3 produce bending and
flexural shear on the beam. The bending moment
produces a different end compressive stress on
the three sheet panels since the bending moment
is not constant over the panel moment. To
simplify we will take average bending moment on
the panel.


Mx(av) = 200 x 52.5 = 10500 in. lb.


f c due to this bending = MxZ/lx = 10500 x
. 4.233/49.3 = 903 psi.


Total f c = 903 + 819 = 1722 psi.


Rc = fc/F c cr = 1722/1900 = .906

The two loads P 3 produce a traverse shear
load V = 200 lb. The flexural shear stress
must be added to the torsional shear stress as
found in Case 2 loading.


Due to symmetry of beam section and P 3
loading the shear flow q at midpoint of sheet
panel (B) is zero. We will thus start at this
point and go clockwise around cell. The shear
flow equation (see Chapter A15) is,

The shear flow q on panel (A) varies from
4.20 to 7.20 or the average q = (4.2 + 7.2)/2
= 5.7. Thus the average shear stress is
5.7/.035 = 163 psi. It is in the same
direction as the torsional shear flow and thus
is additive.


Total f s = 163 + 854 = 917 psi


Rs = fs/F scr = 917/2760 = .332


Rc + R; = 1, Subt.:- .906 + .332 2 = 1.016,
since the result is greater than 1.0, initial
buckling has started. The margin of safety is
slightly negative and equals,

In this example problem, the panels were
assumed simply supported, which is conservative.
Reference to Fig. C5.6 shows that kc could be
assumed higher as the panel is riveted to a
zee shaped stringer which has some torsional
resistance and thus panel is not free to
rotate at its boundaries.


Panel (C) is less critical because the
flexural shear is acting opposite to the
torsional shear stress, thus f s total = 845 163 = 682 psi. The Rs = 682/2760 = .246.


2
Rc + R; = .905 + .246 = .966. Since the
result is less than 1.0, panel will not buckle.


Panel (B) carries a small shear flow,
being zero at center of panel and increasing
uniformly to 1.5 lb. per inch at the edges,
and flowing in opposite directions from the
centerline. Thus transverse shear will have
negligible effect. Thus Rs = 854/2760 = .309.


2
Rc + R; = .905 + .309 = 1.00, or panel
(B) is on the verge of buckling under the
assumptions made in the solution.

**CHAPTER** C6

**LOCAL** **BUCKLING STRESS FOR COMPOSITE SHAPES**



C6. 1 Introduction.


Thin flat sheet is inefficient for carrying
compressive loads because the buckling stresses
are relatively low. However, this weakness or
fault can be greatly improved by forming the
flat sheet into composite shapes such as
angles, channels, zees, etc. Most of the many
composite shapes can also be made by the
extruding process. Formed or extruded members
are widely used in Flight Vehicle Structures,
thus methods of calculating the compressive
strength of such members is necessary.


C6. 2 Compressive Buckling Stress for Equal
Flanged Elements.


The simplest equal flanged member that can
be formed is the angle shape. Other shapes
with equal flanges are the T section and the
cruciform section as shown in Fig. C6.1.

~rlange ~~lange ~
~ ~ ~ciform
Angle T-Section Section


Fig. C6. 1


These sections can be considered as a group of
long flanges, as illustrated, for the angle
section in Fig. C6.2. Since the flanges which
make up the section are equal in size, each
flange will buckle at the same stress. Therefore each flange cannot restrain the other and
thus it can be assumed that each flange is
simply supported along the flange junction as
illustrated in Fig. C6.2.


cr cr cr cr

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-681-2.png)


Fig. C6.2



From Equation C5.1 of Chapter C5, the
buckling compressive stress for a long flange
is,


From Fig. C5.2 of Chapter C5, kc = .43,
then


If the buckling stresses are above the
proportional limit stress, use Fig. C5.7 in
Chapter C5 to take care of the plasticity effect.


For formed angles, the flange width b
extends to centerline of adjacent leg, but for
extruded angles, the width b extends to inside
edge of the adjacent flange or leg.


C6.3 Compressive Buckling Stress for Simple Flange-Web
Elements.


The most common flange-web structural
shapes are channels, zees, and hat sections. A
flange has one unloaded edge free, whereas a
web has no free unloaded edge and thus has an
unknown restraint on the boundary between the
web and the flange. Fig. C6.3 shows the break
down of a Z section into two flange and one web
plate elements.

and Web Elements.


Fig. C6.3

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-681-1.png)


The buckling strength of the web and flange
elements depends on the boundary restraint
between the two elements. If this restraint
which is unknown could be found in terms of a
known rotational restraint E as presented in
Chapter C5, the buckling coefficients could be
found from charts in Chapter C5. Having the

C6.2 LOCAL BUCKLING STRESS FOR COMPOSITE SHAPES



buckling stress for each element, the critical
buckling stress will be the smaller of the two.
The buckling load based on the buckling stress
is not the failing load as more load can be
taken by the material in the corner regions
before local failure or crippling takes place.
The subject of local crippling of formed and
extruded shapes is covered in Chapter C7.


Using the moment distribution method or a
step by step analysis procedure, several
research studies have determined the restraint
factors between web and flange elements for
simple shapes like channels, Z, H, square tUbes
and formulated design charts for such shapes.
(Refs. 1 to 5 inclusive.)


C6.4 Design Charts for Local Buckling Stresses of
Some Composite Web-Flange Shapes.


Figs. C6.4 to C6.7 inclusive give charts
for determining the local buckling stress of
channel, Z, H, square tUbe and hat shaped
sections. For formed sections, the width b
extends to centerline of adjacent element and
for extruded sections the width b extends to
inside edge of adjacent element.


C6. 5 Problems lllustrating Use of Charts.


PROBLEM 1.


The Z section in Fig. (a)
1s formed from aluminum alloy
2024-T3 sheet. What compressive stress will start local
buckling of an element of the
member.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-682-0.png)
Fig. (a)


Solution:

bw = 1.5 - .064 = 1.436

bf = 0.75 - .032 = 0.718


bf/bw = 0.718/1.436 = .50

tw/tf = .064/.064 = 1.0



From Fig. C6.4, we read kw

**=** **2.9**




- - - - (A)



For the plasticity correction of shapes
covered in Fig. C6.4 (Ref. 4), the plasticity
correction for a flange free on one edge can
be used with accuracy. Thus we can use chart
in Fig. C5.7 of Chapter C5.to correct for
plasticity effects.


The parameter for bottom scale of Fig.
C5.7 is equation (A) divided by 00. 7, or
56100/39000 = 1.44. Using this value and the
n = 11.5 curve, we read from Fig. C5.7 that
ocr/a 0.7 = 1.02.


Therefore the local buckling stress is


ocr = 39000 x 1.02 = 39800 psi.


PROBLEM 2.


If the member in Problem 1 is subjected
to a 300 [0] F temperature for 2 hours duration,
what would be the local buckling stress.


From Table Bl.l for this temperature
condition,


00. 7 = 35700, Ec = 10,300,000, n = 15


= 2.9 n [2] x 10,300,000
12{1-.3 [2 ] ) (35700)


1.51.


Using this value on bottom scale of Fig.
C5.7 and n curve = 15, we read ocr/ o 0.7 = 1.03.
Thus ocr = 1.03 x 35700 = 36800 psi.


PROBLEM 3.


Same as Problem 1, but change material to
Titanium Ti-8Mn Sheet.


From Table Bl.l we obtain for this material:Ec = 15,500,000, 0 0• 7 = 119500, n = 13.7.

= 2.9 n [2 ] x 15,500,000 ( .064 )2 = 81200 i
ocr 12(1-.3 [2 ] ) 1.436------ ps •


This stress is near the proportional limit
stress so plasticity correction should be small
if any.


ocr/a 0.7 = 81200/n9500 = .68


From Fig. C5.7, using n = 13.7 curve, we
read ocr/00'7 = .68. Then ocr = 119500 x 0.68 =
81300, thus no plasticity correction.


PROBLEM 4.


The rectangular tube has the dimensions as
shown in Fig. (b). It is extruded from aluminum
alloy 2014-T6. Determine the local compressive
buckling stress.



Ocr = 2.9 n [2 ] x 10,700,000 ( .064)2 - 56100 psi
12{1-.3 [2] ) 1.436

This stress is above the proportional
limit stress of the material, thus a plasticity

on the flange.

C6.4 LOCAL BUCKLING STRESS FOR COMPOSITE SHAPES

In the design of rectangular tUbes, the
designer should select the tube thicknesses for
both long and short sides so that buckling
occurs on both sides, thus giving the lightest
section for buckling strength.



From Fig. Cl.6, we read kh = 5.2.

Ocr - 5.2 TI [2 ] x 10,700,000 ( .04)2 = 21900 psi
   - 12(1-.3 [2 ] ) 1.92    

As shown in Fig. C6.6, buckling occurs on the h
side of the tube. The computed buckling stress
is below the proportional limit stress, thus
no plasticity correction.


PROBLEM 5.



As pointed out previously in this chapter,
the load on the member which causes local
buckling is not the failing or maximum load for
a short length of the member. This local failing
or crippling stress is treated in the next
chapter. Since the buckling stress may fall in
the inelastic stress range, the buckles will not
entirely disappear when load is removed. Since
limit or applied loads must be carried without
permanent distortion, it is thus important to
know when local buckling starts. For those
missile and space vehicles that carry no
humans, the factor of safety on limit loads is
considerably less than for aircraft, thus the
spread between local buckling and local failing
strength becomes important in design.



Same as Problem 4 but change the thickness

C6.6 Buckling of Stiffened Flat Sheets Under Longitudinal
Compression.



Solution:


b = 1 .144- = .856


h = 2 .08 = 1.92

b/h = .856/1.92 = .44-6

tb/th = .04/.072 = .555


From Fig. C6.6, kh = 4.3


2
ocr -_ 4.3 TI 12 x 1-.3 (2) 10,700,000 (.072)2 1.92 = 58600 psi.


This stress is above the proportional limit
stress thus a plasticity correction is necessary.
(Ref. 4) gives no value for a plasticity
correction but recommends the correction for a
clamped long flange which is a slightly conservative correction. This plasticity
correction should also be used for the hat shape
as shown in Fig. C6.7.


Thus Fig. C5.8 of Chapter C5 can be used
to correct for effect of plasticity.


From Table Bl.l, for our material 00.7 =
53000 and n = 18.5.


The value of the parameter for bottom
scale of Fig. C5.8 is Ocr/OO.7 = 58600/53000 =
1.10.


From Fig. C5.8, using n = 18.5 curve, we
read Ocr/00'7 = .91. Therefore ocr = 53000 x
.91 = 48100.


Thus by changing the long side of tube
from .04 to .072, the buckling stress was increased from 21900 to 48100 psi.



In supersonic aircraft, it is important
that the surface skin, particularly that on the
wing, not buckle under flight conditions since
a buckled surface could effect the aerodynamic
characteristics of the airflow around the wing,
thus it is important to know when the skin or
its stiffening units initially buckle in order
to design so that such buckling will not occur
under flight conditions.


Gallaher and Boughan (Ref. 6) and Boughan
and Baab (Ref. 7) determined the local buckling
coefficients for idealized web, Z and T stiffened
plates. The results of their studies are shown
in Figures C6.8 to C6.12 and were taken from
(Ref. 4). The initial local buckling stress
for plate or stiffener is given by the equation:

Ocr ks TI 2 E (.!a) 2 - - - - - - - - (B)
12 (l-))e ") bs


If the buckling stress is above the proportional limit stress of the material, correct
for plasticity effect by using Fig. C5.8 of
Chapter C5.

This stress is no doubt above the proportional limit stress so a check for plasticity
effect will be made. For this effect we use
Fig. C5.8 of Chapter C5.


For our 2024-T3 material, we find from
Table Bl.l of Chapter Bl, that 00.7 = 39000
and the shape parameter n = 11.5.


The bottom scale parameter on Fig. C5.8
is equation (B) divided by 00.7' thus it equals
39800/39000 = 1.02. Using this value and the
n = 11.5 curve on Fig. C5.8, we read on left
side scale that 0cr/OO.7 = .86. Therefore the
buckling stress ocr· .86 x 39000 = 33600 psi.

C7. 1 Introduction.


Chapter C6 was concerned With the local
buckling stress of composite sections when
loaded in compression. Tests of short lengths
of sections composed of flange-plate elements
often show that after the section has buckled
locally, the unit still has the abilit~ to
carry a greater load before failure occurs. In
other words, the local buckling and local
failure loads are not the same. For cases
where local buckling occurs at low stress, the
crippling or failing stress will be higher.
When local buckling occurs at high stress such
as .7 to .8 Fcy, buckling and crippling stress
are practically the same. Fig. C7.1 illustrates
the stress distribution on the cross-section
after local buckling has occurred but prior to
local crippling or failure.


Fig. C7.1

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-687-1.png)


As the load on the section is increased,
the buckles on the flat portions get larger but
most of the increasing load is transferred to
the much stiffer corner regions until the stress
intensity reaches a high enough value to cause
sufficient deformation to cause failure.


A theoretical solution for the local
crippling stress for all types of shapes has
not been developed as the boundary restraint
between flange and plate elements is unknown
and also the manner in which the stress bUilds
up in the corner regions is not well understood.
Consequently, the methods of solution are semiempirical in Character, and the results of such
methods have been sufficiently proven by tests.
Two methods of calculating crippling stresses
will be presented in this chapter.



![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-687-0.png)

The crippling stress for angles, channels,
zees and rectangular tubes can be determined
directly from use of equation C7.1. The
crippling load on an angle unit is then,



presented in (Ref. 1). In this method the
member section is divided into equal or unequal
angles as illustrated in Fig. C7.2. The
strength of these angle elements can be
established by theory or tests. The ultimate
strength or failing strength can then be found
by adding up the strengths of the angle elements
that make up the composite section.


Needham made a large number of tests on
angle and channel sections. From a study of
these test results as well as other pUblished
test data on channels, square and rectangular
tUbes, etc., he arrived at the following
equation for the crippling or failing stress
of angle sections.

structural shapes can be determined by dividing
the shape into a series of angle units and
computing the crippling loads for these
individual angle units by use of equations C7.l
and C7.2. The weighted crippling stress for
the entire section is obtained from the
following equation:

F   - ~ (crippling loads of angles)_ (C7.3)
cs    - ~ (area of angles)


**C7. 3 Design Curves.**


Fig. C7.3 gives curves for determining the
crippling stress of angle units as per equation
C7.l, and Fig. C7.4 gives curves for determining
the crippling loads for angle units. Using
these curves and equation C7.3, the crippling
stress of composite shapes other than angles,
channels, zees and rectangular tUbes can readily
be calculated.


Illustrative problems, using this method,
will be given later and the results compared
With method 2. Crippling stresses for
composite sections should be limited to the
values given in Table C7.l unless sUbstantiated
by test results.

Introduction: References 2 and 3 give
the results of a very comprehensive study by
Gerard on the subject of crippling stresses.
From a thorough study of published theoretical
studies and most available test or experimental
results, Gerard has developed and presented a
more generalized or broader semi-empirical
method of determining crippling stresses. In
one sense it is generalization or broader
application of the Needham method which was
presented as method **1.** The student and
practicing structures engineer should refer to
the above references for a complete discussion
of how the resulting crippling stress equations
were obtained and how these check the extensive
test results. In this short chapter we can
only present the resulting equations, design
curves for same and example problems in the use
of the information, in the determination of
crippling stresses.

C7.6 CffiPPLING STRENGTH OF COMPOSITE SHAPES AND SHEET-STIFFENER PANELS IN COMPRESSION



C7.9 Restraint Produced by Lips and Bulbs.


Quite often in formed sections, the flange
element which has a free edge is rather small
in width as illustrated in Fig. a. Also for
extruded sections, a bUlb is often used as
illustrated in Figs. b. The question then
arises, is the lip or bUlb sufficiently large
enough to provide a simple support to the
adjacent plate element. Since the compressive
buckling coefficient for a plate element is

R J~_b
Lip Lip Bulb
Fig. b


4.0 and 0.43 for a flange element, the use of a
small lip or bUlb can increase the value of the
coefficient considerably above 0.43 and thus
produce a more efficient load carrying element.
The problem of determining the dimensions of a
lip or bulb to give at least a simply supported
edge condition to the adjacent plate element has
been investigated theoretically by Windenburg
(Ref. 5). The results of his studies gives the
following design criterion.

Where IL and AL are the moment of inertia and

From Chapter C5, the compressive buckling
coefficient using Ve = .3 is 0.388 for a flange
element and 3.617 for a plate element. Therefore,

In extruded sections, a circular bulb is
often used to stiffen a free edge as illustrated.

As for the case of the lip, the buckling
stress of the bulb must be greater or equal to
the buckling stress of the adjacent plate
element, which gives,

C7. 10 lllustrative Problems in Calculating Crippling
Stresses.


Problem 1. Find the crippling stress for the
equal leg angle shown in Fig. a. The material
is aluminum alloy 2024-T3.



,Solution by Method 1.


Material properties are:

F cy = 40000, Ec = 10,700,000



T~ .. ~31"-1 .05


1" 16
_1_ Area=.093 Fig. a



Fig. a

For this method, we use Fig.
C7.3. The parameter for bottom scale of Fig.
C7.3 is (a + b)/2t, where (a) and (b) are leg
lengths measured to centerline of adjacent leg
of angle. For our case a = b = 1 - .025 =
0.975. Thus (a + b)2t = 1.95/0.1 = 19.5.


From Fig. C7.3 using 19.5 on lower scale,
and the curve for two edges free, we read on
the left hand scale that Fcc/YFCyE = .0330.
Since we have only one angle, the crippling

stress Fcs Fcc = .0330 x Y40,000 x 10,700,000
= 21600 psi.


Solution by Method 2 (Gerard Method)


For angle sections we use equation C7.4.
A plot of this equation is given in Fig. C7.7.
The parameter for lower scale is,
A Fcy 1./2
(gt2)(~), where A = section area and g

equals the number of flanges plus cuts, or
g = 2 for an angle section. Substituting,


( .093 2) ( 40,000 ) 1. /2 = 1.138
2 x .05 10,700,000


Using this value in Fig. C7.7, we read

~cs/FCY = 0.50. Therefore F cs = 0.50 x 40,000

20,000 psi.


Problem 2. S&TIe as Problem 1, but change
material to aluminum alloy 7075-T6.


F cy = 67,000, Ec = 10,500,000

2 x .05 [2] 10,500,000


From Fig. C7.7, Fcs/F cy = 0.40, whence
F cs = .40 x 67,000 = 26800 psi.


Problem 3. Same as Problem 1 but change
material to Titanium Ti-8Mn. F cy = 110,000,
Ec = 15,500,000.

Solution Method 1.


F cs = Fcc = • 033oVllO, 000 x 15,500,000 = 43000 psi

Problem 10. Find the

extruded bulb angle shown
in Fig. f if material is
20l4-T6 extruded aluminum
alloy.


This particular bulb

Table A3.l6 of Chapter A3 **Fig.** **f**



**C7.9**


as Section No.2. The area from that table is
0.113 sq. in.


Solution by Method 2 (Gerard)


For this material Fcy = 53,000, Ec
10,700,000.


The first question that arises is the bulb
size sUfficient to give an end stiffness to the
(a) leg so that the bulb may be equivalent to
the normal corner.


In Fig. f, bf = 0.78, hence bf/t = 15


Referring to Fig. C7.l2, we observe that
for a bf/t value of 15 we need a D/t ratio of
at least 3.8. The D/t value for our bulb
angle is (7/32)/.05 = 4.4, thus bulb has
sufficient stiffness to develop a corner. The
next question that arises should the bulb
angle still be classed as an angle section
for which equation C7.4 applies or be classed
as a channel or 2 corner section With the bUlb
acting as a short thick leg of the channel.
For this case, equation C7.6 would apply.


The crippling stress will be calculated
by both equations.


By equation C7.4 or Fig. C7.7:

If bulb is considered as a full corner
then g = 4 flanges plus 1 cut 5.


From Fig. C7.7,


FCS/Fcy = .82, hence F cs = .82 x 53000 = 43500


By equation C7.6 or Fig. C7.9,


From Fig. C7.9, Fcs/F CY = .7, hence F cs =
.7 x 53,000 = 37,100.


Possibly the best estimate of the
crippling stress would be the average of the
two above results or 40,300 psi.


In Table C7.l, the so-called cut-off
stress for angles is .7 Fcy and channels .9
F cy - If we use the average value or .8 Fcy,
it gives Fcs = .8 x 53,000 = 42,400 as
maximum permissible because of limited test
results on bulb angles.


For the case where the bulb or lip does
not develop the stiffness necessary to
assume a full corner, then the bulb is only

considered as an additional flange and the g
count would be four instead of 5, thus reducing

Fig. b Sheet stress distribution before buckling



Sheet stress distribution after buckling
EFFECTIVE SHEET WIDTHS


C7. 11 Introduction.



The previous discussion in this chapter
has dealt with the crippling stress of formed
or extruded sections when acting alone, that is
not fastened to any other structure along its
length. However, the major structure of
aerospace vehicles, such as the wing or body,
involves a sheet covering which is strengthened
by attached or integral fabricated stiffeners
such as angles, zees, tees, etc. Since the
sheet and stiffeners must deform together, the
sheet will therefore carry compressive load and
to neglect this load carrying capacity of the
sheet would be too conservative in aerospace
structural design where weight saving is very
important.


C7. 12 Sheet Effective Widths.


Fig. C7.13a illustrates a continuous flat
thin plate fastened to stiffener and the entire
unit is subjected to a uniform compressive load.
Up to the buckling strength of the sheet the
compressive stress distribution is uniform over
both stiffeners and sheet as in (Fig. b) assuming same material for sheet and stiffeners. As
the load is ':'ncreased the sheet buckles between
the stiffeners and does not carry a greater
stress than the buckling stress. However as
the stiffeners are approached, the skin being
stabilized by the stiffeners to which it is
attached can take a higher stress and
immediately over the stiffeners the sheet can
take the same stress as the ultimate strength
of the stiffener, assuming that the sheet has
a continuous connection to the stiffener. Fig.
c shows the general stress distribution after
the sheet has buckled. This distribution
depends on the degree of restraint provided by
the stiffeners and the panel dimension.


Various theoretical studies (Ref. 6) have
been made to determine this stress distribution
after buckling. In general they lead to long
and complicated equations. To provide a simple
basis for design purposes, an attempt has been
made to find an effective width of sheet w
Which would be considered as taking a uniform
stress (Fig. d) which would give the same total
sheet strength as the sheet under the true
non-uniform stress distribution of Fig. c.


The question of sheet effective sheet has
been considered by many individuals. The
names of VonKarman, Sechler, Timoshenko,
Newell, Frankland, Margurre, Fischel, Gerard,
and many more are closely associated with the
present knowledge on effective sheet width.



![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-696-0.png)

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-696-1.png)

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-696-2.png)

Since the crippling or local failing
stress of a stiffener can exceed the yield
strength of the material, equation C7.15 was
later changed by replacing Fcy by the stress
in the stringer FST' thus giving,

Sheet-stiffener panel


Fig. C7.13


From Chapter C5, the buckling compressive
stress of a sheet panel is,


(C7.13)


If we assume that the stiffener to which
the sheet is attached provides a boundary
restraint equal to a simple support, then kc
= 4.0, and if Poisson's ratio _V_ _e_ is taken as
0.3, then equation C7.13 reduces to,



F cr = 3.60E(t/b)2



(C7.14)



The Von-Karman-8echler method as first
proposed consisted of solving equation C7.14
for a width (w) in place of (b), when F cr was
equal to the yield stress of the material
since experiments had shown that the ultimate
strength of a sheet simply supported at the
edges was independent of the width of the sheet.
Thus equation C7.14 changes to,

Fcy = 3.60E(t/w) [2 ], whence,



w = 1.90t vE/FCY - - - - 



- - - (C7.15)


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-697-full.png)

w = 1.90t JE/FST




- (C7.16)



Some early experiments by Newell indicated
the constant 1.90 was too high and for light
stringers a value of 1.7 was more realistic,
thus 1.7 has been widely used in industry.


If we assume the stiffness of the stiffener
and its attachment to the sheet as developing
a fixed or clamped edge condition for the
sheet, then


Fer = 6.35E(t/b)z or w = 2.52t vE/FST


For general design purposes, it is felt
that 1.9 or equation C7.15 is appropriate for
determining the effective width w. If
stiffener is relatively light, use 1.7. Fig.
C7.14 illustrates the effective width for
sheet-stiffener units which are fastened
together by a single attachment line for each
flange of the stiffener.



C7.11


The effective sheet width as calculated by
equation C7.16 assumes that no inter-rivet
buckling of the sheet occurs or, in other words,
the rivet or spot welds are close enough together
to prevent local buckling of the sheet between
rivets when the sheet is carrying the stiffener
crippling stress. The subject of inter-rivet
sheet buckling is discussed later in this
chapter.


Fig. C7.16 illustrates a procedure to
follow for determining the effective width w
when sheet and stiffener are integral in
manufacture.

The crippling stress is determined for
the stiffener alone. This stress is then used
in equation C7.15 to determine the effective
Widths w. The total area then equals the
stiffener area plus the area of the effective
sheet width w. The radius of gyration should
include the effect of the effective skin area.


Fig. C7.15 illustrates the case where
stiffeners are fastened to sheet by two rows
of rivets on each stiffener flange. In this
case, the rivet lines are so close together
that the effective width w for each rivet line
would overlap considerably. A common practice
in industry for such cases is to use the
effective width for one rivet line attachment
as per equation C7.16 to represent sheet width
to go with each stiffener flange. However,
in calculating the crippling stress of the
stiffener alone, the stiffener flange which is
attached to sheet is considered as haVing a
thickness equal to 3/4 the sum of the flange
thickness plus the sheet thickness.


Staggered
Rivet Rows Fig. C7.15



For Case 1, find the crippling stress for
the tee section alone, assuming the vertical
stem of the tee has both ends simply supported.
For value of t in equation C7.15, use
(t s + tf)!2. The effective stiffener area
equals the area of the tee plUS the area of the
sheet of width w.


For Case 2, determine the crippling stress
for the I section acting alone. Calculate w/2
from equation C7.15 to include as effective
sheet area. The column properties should
include I section plus effective sheet.


C7.12 Effective Width WJ. for Sheet with One
Edge Free.


In normal sheet-stiffener construction,
the sheet usually ends on a stiffener and thus
we have a free edge condition for the sheet as
illustrated in Fig. C7.16a. The sheet ends at


Fig. C7.16a


a distance b' from the rivet line. For a sheet
free on one edge, the buckling coefficient in
equation C7.13 is 0.43, thus equation C7.13
reduces to,


Fer = .387E(t/b' )2, and replacing b' by w, we

Then the total effective sheet width for
this end stiffener would thus equal w~ + _w/2._


C7. 13 Effective Width When Sheet and Stiffener Have
Different Material Properties.


In practical sheet-stiffener construction
it is co~~on to use extruded stiffeners which
have different material strength properties in
the inelastic stress range as compared to the
sheet to which the stiffener is attached. For
example, in Fig. C7.17 the stiffener material
could have the stress-strain curve represented
by curve (1) and the sheet to which it is
attached by the curve (2). Now when the
stiffener is stressed to point (B), the sheet
directly adjacent to the stiffener attachment
line must undergo the same strain as the
stiffener and thus the stress in the sheet
will be that given at point (A) in Fig. C7.17.
This difference in stress will influence the
effective width w. Correction for this
condition can be made in equation C7.17 by
mUltiplying it by FSH/FST, which gives



w = 1.90t(FSH/FST) (// ) - - ST



(C7.18)



Where fST is the stiffener stress and fSH is the
sheet stress existing at the same strain as
existing for the stiffener and obtained from a
stress-strain curve of the sheet material.



before the crippling stress of the stiffener
is reached, which means the sheet is less
effective in helping the stiffener carry a
subjected compressive load. Thus, in general,
to save structural weight, structural designers
select rivet spacings that will prevent interrivet buckling of the sheet. In general, the
rivet spacing along the stiffeners in the
upper surface of the wing will be closer together than on the bottom surface of the
wing since the design compressive loads on the
top surface are considerably larger than those
on the bottom surface.


The following method is widely used by
engineers concerned with aerospace structures
relative to calculating inter-rivet buckling
stresses. It is assumed that the sheet
between adjacent rivets acts as a column with
fixed ends.


The general col~~ equation from Chapter
C2 for stable cross-sections is,


                             (C7.19)


Where C is the end fixity coefficient and
varies from a value of 1 for a pin end support
to 4 for a fixed end support.


The effective column length L' = _Live,_
thus equation C7.19 can be written


                     - - (C7.20)


Let p the rivet spacing be considered the
column length L. Assume a unit of sheet 1 inch
wide and t its thickness. Then moment of
inertia of cross section = 1 x t 3 /12, and area
A = 1 x t = t. Then radius of gyration p =
0.29t. Then substituting in equation C7.20 to
obtain the inter-rivet buckling stress Fir,


                 - - - - (C7.21)


For clamped ends C = 4, thus


(C7.22)
_(p/0.58t)"_


To Dlot this equation, the tangent modulus
Et for the material must be known. However, we
can use the various column curves in Chapter C2
which show a plot of Fc versus L'/p and in
equation C7.22 the term _p/0.58t_ corresponds to
L'/p.


The fixity coefficient C = 4 can be used
for flat head rivets. For spot welds it should
be decreased to 3.5. For the Brazier rivet type
use C = 3 and for counter-sunk or dimpled rivets
use C = 1.

For a rather complete study and comparison
of the various effective widths theories as
compared, see article by Gerard (Ref. 7).
Equation C7.15 is in general conservative for
higher bit ratios.


C7.14 Inter-Rivet Buckling Stress.


The effective sheet area is considered to
act monolithically with the stiffener. However, if the rivets or spot welds that fasten
the sheet to the stiffener are spaced too far
apart, the sheet will buckle between the rivets


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-699-full.png)

Figs. C7.18 and C7.19 show a plot of
equation C7.22 for aluminum alloy materials.


If the inter-rivet buckling stress calculates to be more than the crippling stress
of the stiffener, then the effective sheet area
can be added to the stiffener area to obtain the
total effective area. This total effective
area times the stiffener crippling stress will
give the crippling load for the total sheetstiffener unit.


When the sheet between rivets buckles
before the crippling stress of the stiffener is
reached, the sheet in the buckled state has the
ability to approximately hold this stress as
the stiffener continues to take load until it
reaches the stiffener crippling stress. This
buckling sheet strength can be taken advantage
of by reducing the effective sheet area. Thus
effective sheet width equals,


                - - - - - (C7.23)


The area of the corrected effective sheet
is then added to the area of the stiffener.
The crippling load then equals the crippling
stress of the stiffener times the total area.


The use of sheet effective widths in
finding the moment of inertia of a wing or
fuselage cross-section is a widely used procedure in the analysis for bending stresses in
conventional wing and fuselage construction.
Reference should be made to article A19.13 of
Chapter A19 and article A20.3 of Chapter A20
for practical illustrations in the use of
effective Widths.


C7.15 lllustrative Problem Involving
Effective Sheet.


Conventional airplane wing construction
is illustrated in Fig. C7.20. The wing is
covered with sheet, generally referred to as
skin, and this skin is stiffened by attaching
formed or extruded shapes referred to as skin
stiffeners or skin stringers. A typical wing
section involves one or several interior
straight webs and to tie these webs to the
skin, a stringer often referred to as the web
flange member, is required to facilitate this
connection. Fig. C7.21 is a detail of the
flange member and tne connection at point (1)
in Fig. C7.20.


The stiffener or flange member is an
extrusion of 7075-T6 aluminum alloy. The skin
and web sheets are 7075-T6 aluminum alloy. The
skin is fastened to stiffener by two rows of
1/8 inch diameter rivets of the Brazier head
type, spaced 7/8 inch apart. The web is
attached to stiffener by one row of 3/16
diameter rivets spaced 1 inch apart. The



C7.13

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-699-0.png)


problem is to determine the crippling stress of
the stiffener, the effective skin area and the
total compressive load that the unit can carry
at the failure point. Since the stiffener is
braced laterally by the web and the skin, column
bending action is prevented and thus the
crippling strength is the true resulting strength
of this corner member under longitudinal
compression. (Additional stresses are produced
on these corner members if web buckles under
shear stresses and web diagonal tension forces
are acting. This subject is treated in the
chapter on semi-tension field beams.)


Solution:


Area of stiffener = 0.84 sq. in.
For 7075-T6 extrusion, Fcy = 70,000, Ec
10,500,000.


The Gerard method will be used in calculating
the crippling stress. Equation C7.4, or the
design curve of Fig. C7.7, applies to this multicorner shape. The lower scale parameter for
Fig. C7.7 is,


~ (F [CY] )1/2 = 0.24 ( 70,000 )1/2 = 0 63
gt [2] Ec 6 x .072 [2] 10,500,000 

Using this value, we read from Fig. C7.7 that
Fcs/F cy = 0.82. Thus Fcs = .82 x 70,000 =
57,400 psi. The g value of 6 was determined as
shown in Fig. (a).



Effective Sheet Widths:


Equation C7.16 will be
used to determine the sheet
effective widths.


For the skin t = .05.
Material is 7075-T6 aluminum
alloy. Ec = 10,500,000.

effective width with each skin rivet line would

For the web t = .064. Since the web has

countersunk or dimpled. If we make the skin
rivets of the countersunk type, the end fixity
coefficient must be reduced to 1 to be safe.
Then the corrected p/t ratio to use with

This result assumes that no inter-rivet
buckling occurs under the stress of 57,400 psi
in the sheet between rivets.


Th8 skin rivets are Brazier head type
spaced 7/8 inch apart or p = 7/8.


As discussed under inter-rivet buckling,
the end coefficient c for this type of rivet
should be less than 4 or assumed as 3.


Fig. C7.18 gives the inter-rivet buckling
stress versus the p/t ratio. This chart is
based on a clamped end condition or C = 4.
Since C = 3 will be used for the Brazier type
rivet, we correct the p/t ratio by the ratio
14 / /3:: 1.16.


The corrected p/t = 1.16 x .8 [7] 5/.05 = 20.3


From Fig. C7.18 using curve (8) which is
our materi~l, we read Fir = 60,000 psi, thus
skin will not buckle between rivets as
crippling stress is 57,400 psi.


The web rivets are of the flat head type
and C = 4 can be used. Spacing is 1 inch.
Hence p/t = 1/.064 = 15.6 and from Fig. C7.18,
curve 8, we read Fir - 64,600, which is
considerably more than the unit crippling
stress.


In wing construction, the skin rivets are



Gerard (Refs. 2, 3) from a ~omprehensive
study of test results on short sheet-stiffener
panels in compression, has sho\lVYl that his
equation C7.4, or Fig. C7.7, can be used to
give the local monolithic crippling stress for
sheet panels stiffened by Z, Y and H at shaped
stiffeners. The method of calcul~ting the
value of the g f~ctor is illustrated in Fig C7.22. Fig. C7.23 is a photograph showing the
crippling type of failure for a short panel

involving the Z shape stiffener.

article. This sheet buckling does not deform
the flange of the stiffener to which the sheet
is attached. However, if the rivet or spot
weld spacing is such as to prevent inter-rivet
buckling of the sheet, then failure often occurs
by a larger wrinkling of the sheet as
illustrated in Fig. C7.26. The larger wrinkle
shape sUbjects the flange of the stiffner to
which the sheet is attached to lateral forces
and thus the stiffener flange often deforms
with the sheet wrinkle shape. This deforming
of the stiffener flange produc~s stresses on
the stiffener web, thus wrinkling failure is a
combination of sheet and stiffener failure.
The action of the wrinkling sheet to deform
the stiffener flange places tension loads on
the rivets, thus rivet design enters into the
failing strength of sheet-stiffener panels
under compression.

Wrinkling Failure



Several persons have studied this wrinkling
or forced crippling of riveted panels (Refs. 9
and 10). A rather recent study was carried out
by Semonian and Peterson (Ref. 11), which is
reviewed and simplified somewhat by Gerard in
(Ref. 2). The results as given in (Refs. 11
and 2) are used to calculate the wrinkling
stress.

from Fig. C7.27. This coefficient is a function
of the effective rivet offset f which is
obtained from Fig. C7.28. Having determined
kw from Fig. C7.27, equation C7.25 can be solved
by use of Fig. C7.24.


C7.20 Rivet Criterion for Wrinkling Failure.


A criterion for the rivet pitch found from
test data which results in a wrinkling mode
failure is,


(C7.26)


The lateral force required to make the
stringer attachment flange conform to the
wrinkled sheet, loads the rivet in tension. An



The tensile strength of the rivet Sr is
defined in terms of the shank area and it may
be associated with either shank failure or
pUlling of the countersunk head of the rivet
through the sheet.


For aluminum alloy 2117-T4 rivets whose
tensile strength is s = 57 ksi, the criteria

are:

material.


The effective diameter of a rivet of
another material is,

whence, bw/tw = 38,


The rivets are 3/32 diameter Brazier head type
AN456, 2117-T3 material spaced at 0.75 inches.

Area of skin for bs = 2 inches = 2 x .064

Total area of sheet and stiffener = 0.380 in."


Crippling stress of Stiffener Acting Alone.

Fcs(ST) .


Since we have a Z type of stiffener,
equation C7.6 and Fig. C7.9 applies. The lower
scale parameter in Fig. C7.9 is,


From Fig. C7~9, Fcs/F CY =_0.6. Hence, F cs =
.6 x 40,000 - 24,000 psi - Fcs(ST)'


Crippling Stress of Panel Considered as a
Monolithic Limit. FCS(M)'


Equation C7.4 or Fig. C7.7 applies for
monolithic failure of sheet-stiffener panels.


The lower scale parameter on Fig. C7.7 is,


0.380 )( 40,000 )~/"
(
7.83x .064" 10,700,000

= 0.73


g = 7.83 (see Fig. C7.22b)


From Fig. C7.7, we read Fcs/F cy = .725, hence
F cs = 40,000 x .725 = 29,000 psi = FCS(M)'


Inter-Rivet Buckling Stress (Fir)


The rivet type is Brazier head and the
spacing p is 3/4 inch.


Equation C7.24 applies and Fig. C7.24 is
used to solve the equation. The lower scale
parameter in Fig. C7.24 is,


For Brazier head rivet C = 3. _v=_ _.3._
Substituting:

3n" x 10,700,000  -  - (064)~ **'.** 75 ~ = 5. 45
12 (1 - .3")(39,000)


The shape parameter n for our material is
11.5. Reference to Fig. C7.24 for a value of
5.45 on bottom scale which is off the scale,
we estimate the Fir/Fo.7 as above 1.1. Thus



C7.19


Fir = 39,000 x 1.1 = 43,000. This value is far
above the stiffener or panel crippling stress
as previously calculated so inter-rivet
buckling is not at all critical.


Failure by Sheet or Face Wrinkling. (F w)


The wrinkling failure stress by equation
C7.25 is,


To determine value of kw, we use curves in
Figs. C7.28 and C7.27.


p/d = .75/.0937 = 8, bo/t w = 5.36


From Fig. C7.28, we read f/tw = 6.5, whence
f = .064 x 6.5 = 0.416
f/bw = .416/2.437 = .17

(tw/tw)/bs/ts = 38/(2.0/.064) = 1.21


From Fig. C7.27, we read kw = 4.4.


To solve equation for Fw we use Fig. C7.24.
The lower scale parameter is,


k [w] n" E (t [s] )" =
12 (1 - /) e ") (F 0 • 7) bs


4.4 n" x 10,700,000 (.064)" 1 15
12 (1 - .3") (39,000) 2.0 = .'


For n = 11.5, we read from Fig. C7.24 that
Fw /F o. 7 = .9, whence Fw = .9 x 39,000 = 35,100
psi. Thus wrinkling failure is not critical as
Fw is larger than FCS(M) and Fcs(ST)'


The results show that the crippling stress
for the stiffener alone of 24,000 psi is the
smallest value, or the stiffener is unstable as
it fails first. The entire panel unit will
not reach its failing strength when stiffener
stress is 24,000 because the skin wrinkling
stress fw is higher. An approximation suggested
in (Ref. 2) is to assume stiffeners carry the
same stress as the skin up to Fcs(ST) and beyond
this the stiffener carries no additional load.
Thus the panel failing stress F(F) can be
calculated from the following equation.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-705-0.png)


The total load carried by each stiffener plus
its sheet is 27,800 x .380 = 10,600 Ibs.


The failing strength of the riveted panel
cannot exceed the monolithic panel failing stress
FCS(M), which was 29,000 psi for our panel or

For given panel de/t av . = _3132/.064_ = 1.46,

C7. 22 General Design Limitations to Prevent Secondary
Failure in Sheet-Stiffener Panels.


Sheet stiffener units can be designed as
columns if the secondary forms of failure such
as inter-rivet buckling and face wrinkling are
avoided. The following design rules referring
to Fig. (A) will usually avoid these secondary
weaknesses.



_(5)_ _plD_ ::= 8 - - - - - - - - - - Face wrinkling


(6) Tensile strength of rivet or spot weld
attachment per inch should be ~ 0.05 Fcyt s
in order to prevent failure in wrinkling.


(7) As a rough guide do not use bent up
stringers if bslt s < 30 in order to prevent
face wrinkling weakness.


C7. 23 Y Stiffened Sheet Panels 

A Y shape cannot be formed from sheet,
thus it must be extruded. To make the Y shape
efficient, the various parts usually have a
different thickness. Furthermore, the extruded
material has different mechanical properties
in the inelastic stress range as compared to
rolled sheet that is used for the panel, thus
these effects must be considered in calculating
the crippling stress of the stiffener and the
complete panel unit.


The effective thickness t w of the stiffener
is determined by the following equation (Ref. 3):


                - - - - - (C7.29)


where bi and ti refer to the length and thickness, respectively, of the cross-section
elements.


When the yield stress Fcy of stiffener and
sheet are different and effective F CY can be
estimated as follows (Ref. 3):


F cy = {FCY(S~) + FCY(ST) [(twits) -l]}/tw/t s

          - - - - - - - - - - - (C7.30)


The monolithic crippling stress for the
sheet stiffener panel can be calculated from
equation C7.4 or by the curve in Fig. C7.7.
Equation C7.4 is

FCS(M)/Fcy = 0.56 [( gt _IA)(E/F_ 2 _cy_ _)1_ _/_ _2]°.86_


The constant 0.56 in thiS equation applies
for Y and hat-stiffened panels when the ratio
twits = 1.0. For other ratios the correction
of this constant which is referred to as j?g
in Gerard's basic equation can be obtained from
curve in Fig. C7.30.

The compressive monolithic failing stress
of a Y stiffened panel, as illustrated in Fig.
C7.22a, will be calculated by the Gerard method.
Fig. C7.31 shows details of the panel unit.
The stiffener is extruded from 2014-T6 aluminum
alloy for which Fcy = 53000 and Ec = 10,700,000.
The skin or panel sheet is aluminum alloy
7075-T6 for which F CY = 67,000 and Ec =
10,500,000.

Stiffener area = 0.538 in. [2]
Sheet area = 4.21 x .064 = .270 in. [2]
Total area (A) per stiffener unit = 0.808 in. [2]
Radius of gyration of stiffener alone = 1.123 in.

or tw = .0763 inches


Since stiffener and sheet have different

18.83 x .0763 x .064 10,600,000 .68


From Fig. C7.7 we read


Thus the monolithic crippling a failing
stress F csM = F CY x .76 = 64,700 x .76 =
48,200 psi.


The curve as plotted in Fig. C7.7 is for a
tits ratio of 1.0. The ratio for our panel is
.0763/.064 = 1.19. The correction factor from
Fig. C7.30 is 1.03. Therefore FCS(M) = 1.03 x

48200 = 49,600 psi.


Load carried by one stiffener-sheet unit
= 0.808 x 49600 = 40100 lb.


COLUMN STRENGTH


C7.25 Column Curve for Members With

Unstable Cross-Sections.


Chapter C2 dealt with the column strength
of members with stable cross-sections. For
example, if we took a round tube with relatively
heavy wall thickness and tested various lengths
in compression to obtain the failing stress and
then plotted these stress values Fc against the
slenderness ratio L'/p of the member, the test
results would closely follow the curves ABFC in
Fig. C7.32. The type of failure would be
elastic overall bending instability at stresses
between points B-C and inelastic bending
instability at stresses for most of the range
BA. EUler's equation as shown in Fig. C7.32
can be used to determine the failing stress for
both elastic and inelastic bending instability
with the tangent modulus Et being used in the
inelastic stress range.


Now suppose we test various lengths of a
member composed of the same material as used for
obtaining curve ABC, but use a member with an
open cross-section, such as a channel, hat
section, etc., with relatively small material
thickness. The test results for such members
would often follow a curve similar to DEFC in
Fig. C7.32. Thus it is obVious that EUler's
equation cannot be used in the range DEF, as the
true failing stresses are far less than that
given by the Euler column equation. A short
length of the member with L'/p less than 20 will
fail at practically the same stress, thus the
failing stress for lengths up to L'/p = 20 will
be practically the same and this stress has been
given the name of crippling stress (F cs ) and the
previous portion of this chapter has been con

cerned with methods of calculating this local
crippling or failing stress. At point (F) the
elastic buckling of some part of the crosssection begins. Between stress points F to E
the action for the member involves both overall
elastic bending instability plus local buckling
which becomes more extensive as the stress
increases. The portion EF of the column
strength curve is often referred to as the
transition range. At present no reliable
theoretical theory has been developed for
determining the failing stresses in this
transition range, thus resort is made to semiempirical methods which have been checked
against test results and found to give reasonably close results.


C7.26 Methods Used for Determining the Column
Failing Stress in the Transition Region.


METHOD 1. JOHNSON-EULER EQUATION.


Poss.ibly the first method used in calculating the column failing stress Fc in the
transition range EF in Fig. C7.32 was the well
known Johnson-Euler equation which involves the
crippling stress. The equation is,

F 2
Fc :: F cs - 4~~E (L'/p)2 (C7.31)


where, Fc :: column failing stress (psi)
F cs :: crippling stress, assumed to occur
at L'/p :: 0, where L' = L/ve-.



The equation gives a parabolic curve
starting from the crippling stress at L'/p :: 0,
and becomes tangent to the Euler curve at a
stress value equal to one half the crippling
stress. Fig. C7.33 shows a plot of equation
C7.31 for aluminum alloy material for various
values of the crippling stress which is the Fc
stress at L'/p :: O.


This method is qUite simple to use as the
only additional calculation required is the
crippling stress of the column section which is
obtained by methods previously explained in
this chapter. The other methods usually involve
the buckling stress as well as the crippling
stress. Since the crippling stress is normally
constant below L'/p :: 20, the assumption that
Fcs is zero at L'/p = 0 is slightly conservative.


METHOD 2.


The following method or slight variations
of it appears in the structural design manuals
of a number of aerospace com)anies. The method
or procedure for determining the column failing
stresses in the so-called transition range
involves the use of the basic column curve for
stable cross-sections. The procedure can best
be explained by reference to Fig. C7.34.

Fig. C7.34


The curve ABC is the Euler column curve for
a column with a stable cross-section and for a
given material. It involves using the tangent
modulus Et in the inelastic stress range. The
following steps are taken to determine the
column curve for the so-called transition range:

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-709-0.png)

(1) Locate point _(0)_ on the basic column
curve by drawing a horizontal line through
an Fc value equal to Fcy, the yield stress
of the particular material being used.


(2) Draw a horizontal line starting at point
**D.** Point D is at an Fc value equal to the
(F cs ) crippling stress for the column
section being considered. Point (E) on
this line is determined by projecting
vertically downward from point (0).


(3) Locate point (F) at a value of Fc **=** **.9** F cr
where F cr is the buckling stress for the
cross-section. Draw a horizontal line
through point (F) to intersect the column
curve at point (G).


(4) Connect points E and G with a straight
line. The line EG then represents the
column failing stress Fc for values of
L '/p betl'veen points E and G.


This method reqUires the use of the column
curve for stable sections and the determination
of the buckling stress and thus reqUires more
calculations than Method 1. It also requires
a graphical construction.



**C7.23**


METHOD **3.**


Another method that is widely used also
uses a parabolic curve to represent the column
strength in the transition range (see Ref. 12)


The parabolic approximation has the following form:

              - - - - - - - _(C7.32)_


where


Fc is the column failing stress.
F cs is the crippling stress.
Fer is buckling stress for the column
cross-section.
FE is the EUler column stress for the
particular column being considered as
found from equation FE = n2E/(L'/p) [2]


The equation applies for Fe   - F cr . For
cases where Fer> FpL where FpL is the proportional limit stress for the material use FpL
instead of Fer in equation _C7.32._

C7.24 CRIPPLING STRENGTH OF COMPOSITE SHAPES AND SHEET-STIFFENER PANELS IN COMPRESSION



C7.27 Example Problems Involving the Finding
of the Column Strength of Columns With
Unstable Cross-Sections.


PROBLEM 1.


A rectangular tube
21 inches long has the
cross-section as shown
in Fig. (a). The
material is aluminum

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-710-0.png)
alloy sheet 7075-T6, Fig. a
with Fcy = 67,000 and Ec = 10,500,000. If the
member has a pinned end condition, what 1s the
column failing stress.


Solution. The area of cross-section = .234 in. [2]
The least radius of gyration is 0.42 inches.


Before the column failing stress Fc for
the 21 inch length can be found, the crippling
stress F cs and the buckling stress F cr must be
determined.


The crippling stress will be calculated
by the Gerard Method. The parameter for use
with Fig. C7.7 is,


~ (FCY)~/2= .234 ( 67,000 )~/2 = 0 976
gt [2] Ec 12 x .04 [2] 10,500,000 

From Fig. C7.7, Fcs/Fcy = .57, hence F cs =
.57 x 67,000 = 38,200 psi.


The initial buckling stress F cr will be
determined by the theory of Chapter C6.


b = 1 - .08 = .92, h = 2 - .08 = 1.96


b/h = .92/1.96 = .479, tb/th = 1.0

Column Strength by Method 1 (Johnson-Euler eq.)


L = 21 inches L' = L/-JC = 21//1 = 21


L'/p = 21/.42 = 50


The Johnson-Euler equation is,



C7.33 for a value of L'/p = 50 and a value of
Fc = F cs = 38,200 at L'/p = O.


Column Strength by Method 2


This method requires a graphical
construction which involves the column curve
for the given material and for a stable crosssection.


Fig. C7.35 shows the column curve for our
material for a column with stable cross-section.
It is identical to Fig. C2.10 of Chapter C2
for the room temperature condition, except the
curve in Fig. C7.35 has been drawn to a smaller
vertical scale.

The graphical construction to obtain the
column curve in the region between the crippling
stress and the buckling stress is as follows:


At a column stress Fc = Fc = 67,000, draw
a horizontal line to intersect ~he basic column
curve at pOint (0). Draw a horizontal line
from point (D) which equals the crippling stress
of 38,200 psi. Locate point (E) by projecting
vertically downward from point (0). Locate
point (G) at an Fc stress equal to .9 F cr =
.9 x 21,500 = 19,350 psi. Connect points (E)
and (G) by a straight line. This line represents the column failing curve for the member
of our problem for L'/p values between points
(E) and (G). Taking L'/p = 50, we project upward to EG line and then horizontally to scale
at left to read Fc = 27,700 psi.

FE is the Euler column stress for column
with a stable cross-section. To find FE, we
project upward from L'/p = 50 to the curve
AOC in Fig. C7.35 and then horizontally to
read Fc = FE = 41,700 psi.

Fc = 38,200 (1 - 0.225) = 29,600 psi



Example Problem 2.


A formed Z section as
shown in Fig. (b) is used
as a column. The length
L = 30". The member is
braced in the x-x direction
thus column bending failure
must occur about x-x axis.
Material is aluminum alloy,
Fcy = 67,000, Ec = 10,500,000.
Assume the end fixity coefficient c = 1.5.

On Fig. C7.35 point E' is located at

.9 x 20,900 = 18,800 psi. The line E'G' is the
column curve. For L'/p = 45.8, we project upward to line E'G' and then horizontally to left
scale to read Fc = 25,000 psi.

Find the column failing stress.


Solution:


Area of Section = 0.117 in.'"

Px = .535 in.


The initial buckling stress is needed in
finding the column strength.


bw = 1.5 - .04 = 1.46, bf = 0.75 - .02 = 0.73


bF/bw = .73/1.46 = 0.5, tw/tF = 1.0


From Fig. C6.4 of Chapter C6, we read
Kw = 2.9.

The crippling stress will be calculated by
the Gerard Method using Fig. C7.9, which applies
for Z shapes. The lower scale parameter is,

From Fig. C7.9, we read,

30,600 psi.

C7.28 Column Strength of Stiffener
With Effective Sheet.


Column members are often attached to thin
sheet by rivets or spot welding. If the rivet
spacing is such as to prevent inter-rivet
buckling, then the sheet will assist the stiffener
to carry a compressive load and to neglect the
sheet would be too conservative.


If the attached sheet is relatively thin,
that is, less than the stiffener thickness, the
method of using the effective sheet width as a
part of the column area is widely used by
structural designers and will be used in this
example solution.


Example Problems.


For an example
problem, we will assume
that the Z stiffener in
Problem 2 is one of
several stiffeners riveted
to a sheet of .025 thickness and of the same
material as the stiffener.

Fig. c
Solution.


The rivet or spot weld spacing is made
such as to prevent inter-rivet buckling. Thus
the column area will be as shown in Fig. c,
namely, the stiffener area plus the area of
the sheet for the effective width w. Since
the effective sheet width w is a function of
the stiffener stress and since the stiffener


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-712-full.png)

C7.26 CRIPPLING STRENGTH OF COMPOSITE SHAPES AND SHEET-STIFFENER PANELS IN COMPRESSION



stress is a function of the radius of gyration,
the design procedure is of the trial and error
category.


First Trial.


Assume the effective sheet width is based
on column strength of Z stiffener acting alone.
The average column failing stress by the 3
methods in the Problem 2 solution was (25,860 +
25,000 + 26,300)/3 = 25,700 psi.


The effective width equation to be used is,


w = 1.9 t vE/FST


= 1.9 x .025 x/L0,500,000/25,700 = .965 in.


Effective sheet area = 0.965x .025 = .0242


Area of stiffener = Ao = .117


Total area = .1412


Adding the effective sheet to the stiffener
will change the radius of gyration. Mr. R. J.
White (Ref. 13) has developed equation C7.33
which gives the variation in the radius of
gyration in terms of known variables for any
stiffener cross-section. Since the failing
stress of a column is directly proportional to
the radius of gyration squared, equation C7.33
can be equated to the ratio of the column

Sp:or)e:s __ es. Fc __ 1 + [1 + (psot] ~



Where, Po = radius of gyration of stiffener
alone.


p = radius of gyration of sheet and stiffener.


S = distance from centerline of sheet to neutral
axis of stiffener.


t = sheet thickness. w = sheet effective Width.


Equation C7.33 has been put in curve form
as shown in Fig. C7.36, which will now be used
to compute the radius of gyration Po for the
stiffener plus effective sheet.


S = .75 + .0125 = .7625


Po for stiffener alone = .535


S/Po = .7625/.535 = 1.425


w = .965


wt/Ao = .965 x .025/.117 = .2063


From Fig. C7~36 for the above values of
S/Po and wt/Ao, we obtain

(p/PO)2 = 1.05, whence p [2] = .535 [2 ] x 1.05, which
gives p = .548 in.


Then L'/p = 24.5/.548 = 44.8.


Use Method 1 for column strength:

**CHAPTER C8**

**BUCKLING STRENGTH** **OF** **MONOCOQUE CYLINDERS**


This chapter presents information on the buckling strength of Circular cylinders

under compressive, bending and torsional loads acting separately and in combination, without and with internal pressure. Som3 information on the bU.;kling
strength of conical cylinders is presented.



ca. 1 Introduction.


Before the advent of the high speed aircraft and particularly the missile and space
vehicle, the use of the unstiffened cylinder or
monocoque type of structure was qUite limited.
However, the arrival of the space age has
caused the thin walled cylinder to become important in the design of missiles and space
structures.


The classical small deflection theory
which has proved adequate for determining the
buckling strength of flat sheet structures as
covered in Chapter A18, has not proved adequate
for determining the buckling strength of thin
walled cylinders or curved sheet panels since
the theory gives results much too high when
compared with the experimental or test results.


A more recent large deflection theory has
shown closer agreement with experimental
reSUlts, however, the theory reqUires a prior
knowledge of cylinder imperfections. As a
result of the theoretical limi~ations to date,
the strength design of such structures is based
primarily on best fit curves for experimental
or test reSUlts, using theoretical parameters
and curves when they appear applicable.


A missile structure in handling operations
and flight maneuvers is SUbjected to tensile,
compressive, bending and torsional load
systems. The cylinders may be pressurized or
unpressurized. The structural design of such
structures thus requires a knowledge of the
buckling strength under the various load
systems, acting separately and in combination.
This chapter will be confined to giving test
data and design curves for the buckling
strength of cylinders under the various types
of stress systems.


ca.2 Buckling of Monocoque Circular Cylinders
Under Axial Compression.



for the strength design of monocoque structures
indicated that the design curves given in
(Ref. 1) were widely used. It thus seems
appropriate to give some design m~terial from
(Ref. 1).


Cylinders are usually given four classifications relative to length:

(1) Short Cylinders. Short cylinders tend to
behave as flat plate columns (cylinders
with infinite radius). They develop
buckles in a sinusiodal wave form similar
to flat plate buckling. The end fiXity
has considerable influence.


(2) Intermediate or Transition Length of
Cylinders. Buckling involves a mixed
pattern combining sinusiodal and diamond
shapes. The effect of end fixity and
cylinder length are only of nominal
import::mce.


(3) Long Cylinders. Such cylinders buckle in
a diamond shaped pattern, and the length
and,end conditions are not of mu;h importanee.


(4) Very Lonrr, Cylinders. Such cylinders buckle
by over-all colu~n instability or act as a
Euler type column.


Fig. C8.1 shows a photograph of the buckle
failure of an intermediate length cylinder under
axial compression.


The name of Donnell is prominent in the
development of a theory for the buckling strength
of cylinders. From (Ref. 2), Donnell's eightorder differential equation can be used to
provide a small-deflection theoretical solution
to the behavior of cylinders in the short to
long length range. A solution of Donnell's
equation by Batdorf (Ref. 3) gives the critical
stress in terms of the buckling coefficient Kc,
which for sim)ly supported cylinder ends is
defined by the equation:

K c = _[(m2+JS2)2/m2J+[12Z2m2/TI4(m2+J?2)J_



The term monocoque cylinder means a thin
walled cylinder without longitudinal skin
stiffeners or transverse intermediate frames
attached to cylinder skin.

_fJ_ = L/A


_A_ = half wave length of buckles in
circumferential direction.


The compressive buckling stress is given
by,


                    - - - _C8.2_


where, t = wall thickness, L is the cylinder
length and _V_ is Poisson's ratio. The term ~ is
the plasticity correction factor and equals 1.0
for elastic buckling.


Minimization of Eq. C8.1 with respect to
the parameter (m [2] + _jJ2)_ 2/ m 2, gives the critical
buckling coefficient for long cylinders in the
following form:


Kc = (4-!3/n 2)Z = 0.702Z


where Z = (L2/rt)~




- - - _C8.3_


_-_ _C8.4_



Substitution of Eq. _C8.3_ into Eq. _C8.2_
reduces to the well known classical equation



Fcr = CE(t/r)




- - - - - - - - _C8.5_



where, C = _1/J3_ (1- .3 ~~[2]~~ ) = 0.605 for _V_ = .30


The buckling coefficient for simply
supported end conditions in the transition
range can be determined by substituting the
limiting values _ofj3_ = 0 and m = 1 in Eq. C8.1.
A similar solution for cylinders with fixed
edges deviates from the solution for simply
supported cylinders only in the flat plate and
transition ranges.


Figs. _C8.2_ to _C8.5_ inclusive taken from
Reference 1, show the theoretical curve which
shows the buckling coefficient as a function
of the geometrical parameter Z. Theoretically,
the short cylinder range would occur at Z = O.
The values of Kc of 1.12 and 4.12 for Z = 1
correspond quite closely to the buckling
coefficients of simply supported and fixed
ended plate columns. The long cylinder behavior
is represented by a 45 degree sloping straight
line portion of the curve. The curve connecting the short and long cylinder ranges is
referred to as the transition range.


Figs. _C8.2_ to _C8.5_ show the plot of
extensive test data and a 90 per cent probability curve derived by the author of (Ref. 1)
by a statistical approach. Fig. _C8.6_ from
(Ref. 1) shows a plot of much test data on a
logarithmic chart of r/t versus Kc for Z =
10,000. A best fit curve and 90 and 99 percent probability derived curves are also seen
as well as the theoretical curve for C = .605.



ca.3


Observation shows that the theoretical results
are far above the test values. Fig. _C8.7_
(from Ref. 1) is a set of design curves of Kc
versus Z for various r/t values and for 90
percent probability.


ca. 3 Additional Convenient Design Charts for Determining
Compressive Buckling Stress.


Figs. C8.8a and C8.8b are more convenient
design charts as the buckling stress Fc can
cr
be read from the chart, thus avoiding the
calculations involved in using curves in Fig.
_C8.7._ Fig. C8.8a is for 99 percent probability
and 95 percent confidence level and Fig. C8.8b
for 90 percent probability and 95 percent
confidence level. The curves are based on tests
of steel and aluminum alloy cylinders only. The
accuracy of these curves when used for other
materials has not been sUbstantiated by tests.
The 99 percent probability curves are recommended as design allowables for structures whose
failure would be highly critical. The 90 percent curves can be used for less critical

structures.


ca.4 Plasticity Correction.


The plasticity correction for cylinders in
the long range (L [2] /rt ~ 100) is given by the
curves in Fig. _C8.9_ taken from (Ref. 4). In
general most practical cylinders in aerospace
structures will fall in the long cylinder range.

ca. 5 Buckling of Monocoque Circular Cylinders Under Axial
Load and Internal Pressure.


Experiments conducted many years ago
definitely showed that the compressive buckling
strength of monocoque cylinders was increased
if internal pressure was added to the closed
cylinder. Since weight saving is very important
in missile design, the use of pressurized

cylinders in missile structures ha 'become a
common type of missile structural (~sign. The
famous Atlas missile was one of the' first to
use a pressurized monocoque type of $.tructure.


The major reason for the large discrepancy
between the actual test strength and tte
theoretical strength by the linear smalJ
deflection theory that is generally acce~ted
is that the discrepancy is due to geomet~ical
imperfections and the associated stress concentrations. Now large internal pressure~
should smooth out such imperfections and
approach a perfect cylinder and thus the resulting buckling strength should approach t:1at
given by the linear small deflection theory.
However, much of the available test data for
pressurized cylinders gives values below that
given by the linear small deflection theory.
(See Fig. C8.1a for buckling action of
pressurized cylinder.)


One of the first experimental and
theoretical investigations of the effect of
internal pressure upon the buckling compressive
stress of monocoque cylinders was by Lo, Crate
and Schwartz (Ref. 5). They analyzed the
problem of long pressurized cylinders using an
extension of the large deflection theory of
Von Karman and Tsien (Ref. 6). Plotting their
results in terms of the non-dimensional
parameters (p/E)(r/t) [2 ] and (Fcr/E) (r/t), they
found that the buckling coefficient C increased
from the Tsien value (Ref. 7) of 0.375 at zero
internal pressure to the maximum classical
value of 0.605 at (p/E)(r/t)2= 0.169. Fig.
C8.10 taken from (Ref. 1) shows the large
deflection theoretical curve. Also shown are
the experimental values obtained in (Ref. 5)
as well as those obtained by the investigators
in (Ref. 1) and by other investigators in
(Ref. 8). From Fig. C8.10 it is apparent that
large discrepancies exist between the theoretical predicted values and the experimental
values. Lo, Crate and Schwartz suggested that
better correlation with test results could be
obtained if the increment in the buckling
stress parameter (~Fcr/E)(r/t) were plotted as
a function of the pressure parameter as shown
in Fig. C8.11. The increase in the critical
stress nFcr due to the internal pressure
directly represents the beneficial effect of
the internal pressure. The total critical
stress is thus obtained by adding the critical
stress for the unpressurized cylinder to the
increase in the critical stress due to the
internal pressure. In order to plot the test
points in Fig. C8.11, it was necessary to
determine the unpressurized critical buckling
stress for each test. The 90 percent probability values from Fig. C8.7 were used.. As
shown in Fig. C8.11, the general trend of the
test data agrees fairly well with the theoretical curve. The investigations in Ref. 1



ca.7


have shown a best fi~ curve and a 90 percent
probability curve obtained by a statistical
approach and this 90 percent curve in Fig.
C8.11 is recommended as a design curve for
taking into account the effect of internal
pressure.

BUCKLING OF MONOCOQUE CIRCULAR
CYLINDERS UNDER PURE BENDING


ca.6 Introduction.

Flight vehicles are SUbjected to forces in
flight and in ground operations that cause bending action on the structure, thus it is necessary
to know the bending strength of cylinders. Two
rather extremes have been used in past design
practice. One design assumption takes the value
of the bending buckling stress as 1.3 times the
buckling stress under axial compression. The
other assumption is to assume the bending buckling

stress is equal to the axial compressive
buckling stress. The first assumption is considered by some designers as somewhat unconservative while the second assumption is no
doubt somewhat conservative.


It is relatively recent (Ref. 10) that a
small deflection approach has been completely
solved for a cylinder in bending. Tests of
cylinders in bending show that the theoretical
result is lower than the test results but
higher than the buckling stress in axial compression. No large deflection analysis which
involves a consideration of initial imperfections of the cylinder has been formulated
to date for the buckling strength in bending.
Since the stress in bending varies from zero
at the neutral axis to a maximum at the most
remote element, the lower probability of
imperfections occurring within the smaller
highest stressed region would lead one to
conclude that higher buckling stresses in
bending, as compared to the buckling stress in
axial compression, should be expected.


ca.7 Available Design Curves for Bending Based
on Experimental Results.


The same investigators (Suer, Harris,
Skene and Benjamin) that carried out tests on
cylinder in axial compression (Ref. 1), have
also carried on an extensive investigation of
the buckling strength of monocoque cylindrical
cylinders in pure bending (see Ref. 9).


As originally developed by Flugge (Ref.ll)
for long cylinders, the buckling stress in
bending is expressed as:

                     - C8.6


The theoretical vlue of the bending
buckling coefficient as found by Flugge was
about 30 percent higher than the corresponding
classical buckling coefficient of 0.605 in
axial compression.


Fig. C8.12 (from Ref. 9) gives a plot of
considerable test data and a plot of Cb versus
(r/t). A best fit curve, a 90 percent probability curve and a 99 percent probability curve,
are shown. The dashed curve is a plot of the
90 percent probability curve as previously
given in Fig. C8.6 for buckling in axial compression, thus giving a comparison between
bending and compressive buckling strengths. As
indicated by the plotted test points, the test
data above an r/t value of 1500 is qUite
limited, thus the accuracy of the curves is
somewhat unknown.


Figs. C8.13 and C8.l3a give convenient
design curves for finding the bending buckling
stress based on 99 percent probability and 90

percent probability and confidence level of 95
percent. These curves are from the structures
manual of the General Dynamics Corp. (Fort
Worth.) Their manual states that most of the
test data upon which the curves are based fall
Within the range of cylinder dimensions .25 <
L/r < 5, and 300 < r/t < 1500, and the curves
are based on tests of steel, aluminum and brass
cylinders only.


ca. a Buckling Strength of Circular Cylinders in Bending
with Internal Pressure.


The pUblished information on the buckling
strength of circular cylinders in bending with
internal pressure is very limited and the status
of theoretical studies to date leave much unknown regarding this subject.


Reference 9 gives the results of a series
of tests of circular cylinders in bending With
internal pressure. Fig. C8.14 is taken from
that published report. In Fig. C8.14 the experimental data are plotted in terms of the
increment ~Cbp to the buckling coefficient Cb.
The increase in the buckling stress coefficient

~Cbp represents the beneficial effect of
internal pressure. The total value of the
buckling coefficient is obtained by adding the
buckling coefficient for unpressurized cylinders
to the increase in the buckling coefficient due
to the internal pressure. In order to plot the
data, it was first necessary to determine the
unpressurized buckling coefficient for each
specimen. The 90 percent probability design
curve of Fig. C8.12 was used for this purpose.
The direct benefit of lateral internal pressure
to the stability of cylinders in bending is
indicated by those specimens with no net axial
stress (the balanced specimens) represented by
the circular symbols. At large values of the
pressure parameter, the additional benefit of
the axial pretention is clearly demonstrated by
the large increase in ~Cbp of the pretensioned

specimens, represented by the triangular
symbols, over that for balanced specimens. The
limiting value of the increase in the buckling
stress coefficient for pretensioned pressurized
cylinders at very high values of the pressure
parameter is given by the line ocr = pr/2t.


The analysis of the pressurized cylinder
data was achieved by selecting a best fit curve
for those specimens in which the axial pretension was balanced. This curve (shown in
Fig. C8.14) was selected by the investigators
as best indicating the general trend of the
experimental data. At large values of the
pressure parameter, the curve is drawn to
approach an asymptote agreement between the
best fit curve and experimental data is
apparent in Fig. C8.14. A statistical analysis
of the test data was performed for the specimens with no axial pretension to establish the
90 percent probability design curve shown in
Fig. C8.14. Because data were available only
from the tests made by the investigators, they
indicate the sample may not be representative
and a lower probability curve should perhaps
be used for design purposes. The data was not
considered sUfficient to permit a statistical
analysis of the pretensioned test data, and
therefore they suggest a lower bound curve be
used in the design of pretensioned cylinder.
Additional tests are needed too for unpressurized cylinders with r/t ratios greater than
1500 to verify the shape of the design curve.

Schildcrout (Ref. 15). Their theoretical investigation utilized a modified form of the
single eqUilibrium form of Donnell (Ref. 2) and
by use of Galerkins Method obtained the curve
shown in Fig. CS.17. This theoretical curve
falls above the test results and thus for safety
a lowered curve shoUld be used for design
purposes. Fig. CS.1S shows a design curve which
appears in the structural design manuals of a
number of aerospace companies.

ca.12 Buckling Under Transverse Shear.



Shear stresses are also produced under
bending due to transverse loads. These shear
stresses are maximum at the neutral axis and
zero at the most remote portion of the cylinder
wall, whereas the torsional shear stress is
uniform over the entire cylinder wall. Limited
tests indicate a higher buckling shear stress
under a transverse shear loading as compared
to the torsional buckling stress. A general
procedure in industry is to increase the shear
buckling stress under torsion by using 1.25
times kt. Thus in Fig. C8.18 find kt for
buckling under torsion and then mUltiply it by
1.25 in using Equation C8.9 to find buckling
stress under transverse shear.


ca. 13 Buckling of Circular Cylinders Under Pure Torsion
With Internal Pressure.


Internal pressure places the cylinder
walls in tension, thus the torsional buckling
stress is increased as torsional buckling is
due to the compressive stresses that are
produced under shear forces.


Hopkins and Brown (Ref. 13), using
Donnell's equation, calculated the effect of
internal pressure on the buckling stress of
circular cylinders in torsion and the results
were in fair agreement with test results.


Crate, Batdorf and Baab (Ref. 14),
utilized an empirical interaction equation to



fit test data. The derived interaction equation

was:

Rst 2 + Rp = 1 - - - - - - - - - - - - - C8.l0


where,


applied torsion shear stress
Rst = ratio of allowable torsion shear stress


applied internal pressure
Rp=ratio of external hydrostatic buckling ~~pressure~~


Note that Rp has a negative sign. The
value of the external hydrostatic buckling pressure can be determined by use of Fig. C8.15.
Fig. C8.22 shows a plot from Equation C8.10 and
its comparison with test data.


ca.14 Buckling of Circular Cylinders Under Transverse
Shear and Internal Pressure.


For this load system, the derived interaction equation is similar to Eq. C8.10.



R s + R p = 1


where,


applied transverse shear stress
allowable transverse shear stress


Rp is same as explained in Article C8.13.

ca. 15 Buckling of Circular Cylinders Under Combined
Load Systems.


It is very seldom that a circular cylinder
used in an aerospace structure such as a
missile is sUbjected to a load system causing
only one internal stress system such as axial
stress, bending stress, and shearing stress.
Therefore it is necessary to be able to safely
determine the buckling strength under the
practical cases of combined stress systems.
This problem is handled by the use of interaction equations.


Table C8.1 summarizes the interaction
equations that appear in the structures design
manuals of several aerospace companies. These
equations no doubt have been proven reliable
by checking against test data. Fig. C8.23
gives a plot of three interaction curves.
These curves are useful in qUickly observing
whether cylinder is weak and to determine
margins of safety.

C8.18 BUCKLING STRENGTH OF MONOCO UE CYLINDERS


carry using design curves based on 90 percent The bending moment developed at this
probability. buckling stress is,



Solution:


r/t = 50/.05 = 1000, L/r = 75/50 = 1.5



M = Fb I/r = Fb n r '"t
cr cr

**=** **1710** **11** **x** **50** **X** **.05** **=** **670,000** **in.** **lb.**



kcn"E t" If we use Fig. C8.13a based on 90 percent
= 12 (1 - _2I_ _e_ ") (L) (See Eq. C8.2) probability and 95 percent confidence, we read
for r/t = 1000 and L/r = 1.5 that Fbcr/E is



To find the buckling coefficient kc, we
use Fig. C8.7.


Z = ."....,...c--=--=-= 75" / 1 - .3 2 = 2140
50 x .05


From Fig. C8.7 using Z = 2140 and r/t =
1000, we read kc = 280, then


F cr - 280- n" 12 (1 - x 10,700,000 .3 ") (.05)" 75 = 1210 psi


The buckling axial compressive load
P = 2nrt F cr = 2n x 50 x .05 x 1205 = 18950 lb.


If we use the design curves of Fig. C8.8b
based on 90 percent probability and 95 percent
confidence, we read for r/t = 1000 and L/r =
1.5, that Fc /E = .000121. Thus Fc =
cr cr
10,700,000 x .000121 = 1295 psi. If we multiply
this value by the .95 confidence value, we
obtain 1230 psi which is practically the same
as obtained above using Fig. C8.7.


Pa = 1295 x 2n x .05 x 50 = 20350 lbs.


If we require 99 percent probability and
95 percent confidence, we use Fig. C8.8a. For
r/t = 1000 and L/r = 1.5, we read Fs cr IE =
.000082 or Fs = 10,700,000 x .000082 = 877
psi, which woald give an axial buckling load
of 13,700 lbs. Thus requiring a 99 percent
probability decreases the buckling load
considerably.


Problem 2. Bending strength


The same cylinder as used in Problem 1 will
be used in this example problem. What bending
moment will buckle this cylinder under 90
percent probability.


Solution. The curve in Fig. C8.12 will be
used. For r/t = 1000 and L/r = 1.5, we read
from Fig. C8.12 that the bending buckling
coefficient Cb = .16.


F b cr = CbEt/r (See Eq. CB.5)



.000160. Thus Fb cr = 10,700,000 x .000160 =

1710 psi. Since it is difficult to read Fig.
CB.12, it is recommended that Fig. C8.13a be
used in design.


If we require 99 percent probability, we
use Fig. CB.13 and ob~ain Fbcr/E = .000092,


which gives Fb cr = 10,700,000 x .000092 = 985
psi as against 1710 for 90 percent probability.


Problem 3. Torsional Strength.


Same cylinder as in Problem 1. What
torsional moment will this cylinder develop.


Solution. Using design curve in Fig. CB.18


Z = rt L [2] /l-2I e" = 50x.05 75" /1_.3,---- 2 = 2140


For this value of Z, we read the torsional
buckling coefficient kt from Fig. C8.1B to be
170.



Fst
cr



(See Eq. C8.9)



Fst cr = 17On" x12 (1 - 10,700,000 .3 [2 ] ) ('7 [0] 5 [5] )2 = 735 psi


The torsional moment developed by this
bucKling stress is,


T = Fst cr J/r. J/r = 2nr 3 t/r = 2nr 2 t


whence,


T=F 2nr 2 t
st cr


T = 735x2nx50 [2] x .05 = 578000 in.lbs.


The result will also be calculated using
Figs. C8.20 and C8.21 based on 99 percent and
90 percent probability respectively and 95
percent confidence. Using Fig. CB.21:

For r/t = 1000 and L/r = 1.5, we read
Fst/E = 000082. Then Fst = .000082 x 10,700,000
= 876 psi. T = 876 x 2n x 50 2 x .05
= 688000 in.lbs.



= .16 x 10,700,000 x .05/50 = 1710 psi Using Fig. C8.20 which is for 99 percent proba

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-733-full.png)

bility, we read Fst/E = .000060 which gives
Fst = 642 psi which, in turn, gives allowable
torque T = 504000 in. Ibs.


Problem 4. Combined Compression and Bending.


The cylinder of Problem 1 is sUbjected to
an axial compressive load P of 10,700 Ibs. and
a bending moment M of 282,000 in. Ibs. What is
the margin of safety under this combined loading for 90 percent probability and 95 percent
confidence.


Solution. The interaction equation for this
type of combined loading from Table C8.1 is,


Rc + Rb = 1


Rc = P/Pa . (Pa from Problem 1 solution is
20350 lb.)


Rc = 10700/20350 = .527


Rb = MIMa (From Problem 2 results:- Ma =
670,000 in.lbs.)


Rb = 282,000/670,000 = .421


Rc + Rb = .527 + .421 = .948. Since the result
is less than 1.0, we have a small margin of
safety.


1 1
M.S. = Rc + Rb - 1 = .948 - 1 = .055


Problem 5. Combined Compression, Bending and
Torsion.


Same cylinder as in Problem 1. The loading is the same as Problem 4 plus a torsional
moment T of 89300 in. lb. Fing the M.S. under
this combined loading for 90% probability.


Solution.


The interaction equation for this combined load system from Table C8.1 is,


                                  -                                   (A)


From Problem 4, Rc = .527, Rb = .421,
Rst = T/Ta • (From Problem 3 results: Ta is
688,000 in. lb.)


Rst = 89300/688,000 = .13


Subt. in Eq. (A):

.527 + .421 + .13 [2] = .965, (since this result
is less than 1.0, we hav8 a small margin of
safety. From Table C8.1,

C8.19

Problem 6. Combined Compression, Bending,
Torsion and Transverse Shear.


The same cylinder as in Problem 1 is subjected to the following loads:

P = 10700 Ibs. compression, M = 282,000 in.lbs.,
T = 715000 in.lb., V = 1790 lb., (transverse
external shear). Will the cylinder carry this
combined loading under 90 percent probability.


Solution:


From Table C8.1 the interaction equation
for this combined loading is,


_"_
Rc + Rst 2 _V"_ + Rs + Rb = 1 - - - - - - - (B)


Rc = 10700/20350 = .527


Rb [=] [ 282000/670000] = [ .421]


Rst = [71500/688000] = [ .104]


The equation for shear stress due to
transverse shear load V is,


V
f s = T _J_ ydA


I for cylinder secti on = nr "t area = nrt

JYdA = nrt x .6366r = 2 r [2] t _ r;;qJ3~6r


f s = _V_ nr"t (2 r2t) = ..Y- nrt


f s = 1790/n x 50 x .05 = 228 psi.


From Article C8.12 we use buckling coefficient for transverse shear to be 1.25 times
that for torsional buckling.


From Problem 3 the torsional buckling stress
calculated to be Fst = 876 psi. Therefore the
transferse shear buckling stress is 1.25 x 876

- 1095 psi, = Fs


Rs = fs/F s • 228/1095 = .208


SUbstituting in Equation (B),


.527 + .104 [2 ] + _yf.208"_ + .421" = .975. This
result is less than 1.0 so a small margin of .

safety exists.


Problem 7. Combined Compression, Bending and
Transverse Shear.


Same cylinder and loads as in Problem 6,
but without the torsional moment load.


Solution: The interaction equation is,

C8.20 BUCKLING STRENGTH OF MONOCO UE CYLINDERS



= 1      - (C)


Rc = .527, Rb = .421 and Rs = .208 (from
Problem 6)


Subt. in Equation (C),


 - 527 + ~.2083 + .421 [3] = .964 (less than 1.0
thus cylinder will not buckle.)


Problem 8. Combined Bending and Torsion.


Using the same cylinder as in previous
problems, the combined loading is:

M = 478,000 in.lbs., T = 358,000 in. lb.


Will the cylinder buckle under this loading.


Solution:


Rb = 470,000/670,000 = .701


Rst = 358,000/688,000 = .520



C8. 17 Problems Involving Internal Pressure with
External Loadings.


The same cylinder and material as was used
in Problems 1 to 9 will be used in the following
example problems, namely, r = 50, t = .05, L =
6
75, E = 10.7 X 10 

Problem 10. Axial Compression with Internal
Pressure.


The cylinder is sUbjected to an axial compressive load of 50000 Ibs. and an internal
pressure of 5 Ibs. per sq. in. What is the
margin of safety under this combined load system
with 90 percent probability.


Solution. From Problem 1, the buckling compressive stress Fc cr With no internal pressure
was 1295 psi. To obtain the increase in the
compressive buckling due to the internal pressure, we use Fig. C8.11. The horizontal scale
parameter is,



The interaction equation from Table C8.1 is, E p IT (r) 2 _ - 10,700,000 5 ( 50 ).05 2 = .467



Rb [1] .& + Rst [2] = 1


.701 [1] .& + .520 [2] = .88 less than 1.0, therefore
cylinder will not buckle.


The margin of safety can be determined
graphically by using Fig. C8.21 as follows:

Find point (a) as indicated on Fig. C8.21
using Rb = .701 and Rst = .520. Draw line
from origin 0 through point (a) and extend it
to intersect interaction curve at point (b).
Projecting downward and horizontally from
point (b), we read Rb = .78 and Rst = .58.


The factor of utilization U = .70/.78 =
.52/.58 = .895. Therefore Margin of Safety =
(l/U) - 1 = (1/.895) - 1 = .12.



From Fig. C8.l1, we read on vertical scale,


/:'F Ccr (....!:....)
~ Et = .19, Whence


/:'F ccr = (~x .19 x 10,700,000 x .05)/50 = 203571 psi


Since the stress is below the proportional
limit stress the plasticity correction is zero
or ~ 'I = 1.0. Thus /:'F c cr -- = 2035 psi.


Then the total buckling stress with the
internal pressure is 1295 + 2035 = 3330 psi.


Now the internal pressure produces a longitudinal tensile stress in the cylinder wall.
This tensile stress is,



Problem 9. Combined Compression and Torsion. Ft = pr/2t = 5 x 50/2 x .05 = 2500 psi



Same cylinder as in previous problems.
The loads are P = 12900 Ibs. T = 358000 in.lbs.
What is M.S.


Solution: The interaction equation from Table
C8.1 is, Rc + Rs t 2 = 1


Rc = 12900/20350 = .634


Rst = 358000/688000 = .520


.634 + .520 [2] = .904 (less than 1.0, therefore no buckling.)


2
M.S. .08



This tensile stress must be cancelled before
walls can be sUbjected to a compressive stress
due to an external compressive axial load. The
allowable failing load Pa thus equals,


Pa = 2nrt (F c cr + /:'F c cr + Ft)

= 2n x 50 x .05 (3330 + 2500) = 91500 lb.


M.S. = (Pa/P) -1 = (91500/50000) - 1 = .83.


This result shows the tremendous effect of
internal pressure in increasing the compressive
strength of a thin walled unstiffened cirCUlar
cylinder. With no internal pressure, the
failing compressive load as calculated in


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-735-full.png)

Problem 1 was only 20350 Ibs. as compared to
95000 Ibs. with 5 psi internal pressure.


Problem 11. Bending with Internal Pressure.


If the same cylinder as used in the preceding example problems is SUbjected to a
bending moment of 3,000,000 in. Ibs. when
internal pressure is 5 psi, what is the l'LS.
use 90 percent probability.


Solution. For bending without internal
pressure, the bending buckling stress Fb cr was

found in Problem 2 to be 1710 psi. The increase in this bending buckling stress due to
internal pressure is obtained from the curves
in Fig. C8.14. The horizontal scale parameter
is,


.2.. (~) 2 = 5 ( 50 ) 2 4.67
E t 10,700,000 .05


From Fig. C8.14, we read


~Fb
-E (.!:..) = .51 for 90 percent probability.
E t


whence, ~Fbcr = (.SlxIO,700,000x .05)/50 =

5350 psi.


As calculated in Problem 11, the internal
pressure of 5 psi produces a longitudinal
tensile stress in the cylinder wall equal to
Ft = 2500 psi. The allowable bending moment
that cylinder can develop is,


= 1710 + 5350 + 2500 = 9560 psi.


Ma = 9560xnx50 2 x .05 = 3760000 in. Ibs.


M.S. = (MaIM) **-1** **=** (3760000/3000000) - 1 = .25


Again note the tremendous effect of
internal pressure on the bending strength.
With no internal pressure, the failing bending
moment was 670000 as compared to 3760000 with
5 psi internal pressure.


Problem 12. Combined Compression, Bending and
Internal Pressure.


The same cylinder will be subjected to an
axial load P = 51000 Ibs., a bending moment
M = 1475000 in. Ibs., and an internal pressure
of 5 psi. Use 90 percent probability. What
is the margin of safety under these load
conditions.



**ca.21**


Solution:


Interaction equation is, Rc + Rb = 1


From Problem 10, the allowable load Pa for
compression plus 5 psi, internal pressure is
95000 Its.


RC = p/P a = 51000/95000 = .536


From Problem 11, the allowable bending
moment Ma with an internal pressure is 3,760,000
in. Ibs.


Rb = MIMa = 1475000/3760000 = .392


Rc + Rb = .536 + .392 = .928 (less than 1, thus
will not buckle)


M.S. = (1/.928) - 1 = .08


Problem 13. Torsion with Internal Pressure


If the same cylinder is SUbjected to an
internal pressure of 5 psi, what pure torsional
moment Ta will it carry without buckling.


Solution:


With no internal pressure, the torsional
shearing buckling stress as calculated in
Problem 3 was 876 psi. for 90 percent probabili ty.


The increase in shear buckling stress due
to the internal pressure will be determined by
use of interaction curve in Fig. C8.22. To use
this curve, the external hydrostatic pressure
(Pext.) to cause buckling of the cylinder must
be determined. This buckling stress FcCI' is


determined by equation C8.7, which is,

2
k p n e t 2
FCcI' = 12 (1 - _V_ _e_ _2 )_ _(1)_


The buckling coefficient kp is found by
use of Fig. C8.15.


z = ~ rt (1 - _V_ _e_ 2):1./2 = 2140 (See Problem 1)


From Fig. C8.15, we read kp = 60


F = 60n 2 x 10,700,000 (.05) 2 = 258 psi
ccr 12 (1 - .3 [2 ] ) 75


The external pressure to produce this
circumferential stress in the cylinder wall
would be


Pext. = FCCI' t/r = 258 x .05/50 = .258 psi


Fig. C8.22 is now used to find the increase
in the torsional shear buckling stress due to


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-736-full.png)

C8.22 BUCKLING STRENGTH OF MONOCOQUE CYLINDERS



the internal pressure of 5 psi. The lower
scale parameter is,


Pint - Pext = 5 - .258 = 4.74


Using this value we read from C8.22 that
Fst cr = 5280 psi. This buckling stress will

develop a torsional moment of


Ta = Fst cr (2n r 2 t)

= 5280 (2n x 50 [2] x .05 = 4,150,000 in. lb.


Reference to the interaction curve in Fig.
C8.22 shows most of the test data falling
below the curve. A 90 or 99 percent probability
would give a curve considerably below the
curve shown. A correction factor of around .8
would seem to be in order or .8 x 5280 =
4220 psi.


The buckling stress can be calculated by
use of the interaction equation:


2
Rst + Rp = 1, Rst = fst/Fstcr


Rp = 5.0/.258 = 19.4 (use minus sign)


f s t 2
8762 = 1 + 19.4, or fst = 3940 psi.


Thus to cause torsional buckling with 5
psi internal pressure requires a torsional
shear stress of 3940 psi.


Then the torsional moment developed =
2
3940 (2n x 50 x .05) = 3,100,000 in.lb.


Problem 14. Combined Compression, Bending,
Torsion and Internal Pressure.


The same cylinder is subjected to a
combined loading of P = 40750, M = 1,670,000,
T = 700,000 and internal pressure of 5 psi.
Will cylinder buckle.


From Problem 10, Pa = 95,000


From Problem 11, Ma 3,760,000


From Problem 13, Ta = 3,100,000


The stress ratios then are:   

Rc = 40,750/95,000 = .431


Rb = 1,670,000/3,760,000 = .444


Rst = 700,000/3,100,000 = .226


R s t 2 = The 1. interaction equation is Rc + Rb +


2
.431 + .444 + .226 = .926.



This is less than 1.0, thus cylinder will
not buckle under the given combined loading.


C8.17 Buckling Strength of Thin-Walled (Monocoque)
Conical Shells.


In a mUlti-stage missile, the upper stages
normally have smaller diameters than the lower
stages, thus a conical shell provides a type of
structure to permit changing the missile
diameter between the various stages.


As for the case of the cylindrical
monocoque shell, the theoretical analysis for
the buckling strength of conical shells by
either the small or large deflection theories
gives results considerably above those given
by tests, thus design of conical shells at
present is based primarily on results obtained
by tests. The material presented in this
chapter will thus be limited to presenting a
few design buckling curves.


C8.18 Allowable Compressive Buckling Stress for
Thin-Walled Conical Shells.


Fig. C8.24 shows design curves for the
compressive buckling stress of a conical shell
as derived from a statistical study of test
data by Hausrath and Dittoe (Ref. 16). The
expression for the buckling compressive stress
along a generator at mid-height of cone is,


Per


where, Per is the buckling axial compressive
load on cone.


p = radius of curvature of cone at midheight.


t = cone wall thickness.


_a_ = semi-vertex angle of cone.


Data from 170 tests by various investigators were statistically evaluated for expected
men, 90 percent and 99 percent probability
strength levels. Dispersion of data was found
to be slightly less than that of monocoque
cylinders. Non-linear effects of radius to
thickness ratio or strength deterioration with
length to radius ratio were not discernible.


The "A" level curve in Fig. C8.24 is that
level which would be exceeded by at least 99
percent of the entire test population with 95
percent confidence; that is, the confidence is
95 percent that at least 99 percent of the
compressive strengths of all cones can be
expected to exceed the "All level curve. The
liB" level curve is for 90 percent probability
and 95 percent confidence.

C8.23


Buckling Under Combined Loading


From Boeing Report (D2-3617) the effects
of simultaneous compression, bending, shear and
overpressure can be considered using the interaction equation:

(R c + Rb + RV)~·2 + Rq~·2 = 1


where, Rc = fc/F c, Rb = fb/Fb, Rv = 1.f~st


Rq = q/qcr

The "A" and "B" curves are recommended for
practical design. The "A" level curve is
recommended for use for those structures where
a single failure would result in catastrophic
loss or injury to personnel. The stress level
at the small end of the cone should be checked
to preclude the possibility of an early failure
precipitated by inelastic stresses.


C8. 19 Additional Design Buckling Curves for ThinWalled Conical Shells.


Figs. C8.25, 26, 27 gives curves for
determining the allowable buckling stress for
thin-walled conical shells in compression,
bending and torsion respectively. These curves
are reproduced by permission of the Boeing
Company from their report D2-3617. Fig. C8.28
gives a design curve for the allowable
external buckling pressure for thin-walled
conical shells, also from same Boeing Report.
These curves were used for minuteman interstage
and skirt design and the conical shells had
ring stiffeners designed by method given in
(Ref. 17).


DEFINITION OF TERMS:


A conical shell with wall thickness t =

fabricated from aluminum
alloy (E = 10,700,000).
Determine the following
values:- [20]



(1) Allowable compressive load Pc.

Solution:


p = [10/cos] [ 10] [0] [ =] [10.16] [ in.]
pit = 10.16/.05 = 203
L = [20/cos] [ 10] [0] [ =] [20.32] [ in.]
L/p = 20.32/10.16 = 2.0


To find Pc :

From Fig. C8.25 with pit = 203 and L/p =
2.0, we read Fc x 103/E equals 1.20. Whence
Fc = 1.20 x 10,700,000/1000 12,820 psi. Then
Pc Fc 2 n rt
12820 x 2n x 10 x .05 = 40,300 lbs.


To find M cr :

From Fig. C8.26 with pit = 203 and L/p =
2.0, we read Fb x 103/E = 1.48. Whence Fb =
1.48 x 10,700,000/1000 = 15820 psi. Then
M cr Fb n r [2] t
= 15820 n x 10 [2 ] x .05 = 248,500 in. lb.


To find T cr :

From Fig. C8.27, with pit = 203 and L/p =
2.0, we read Fst x 103/E = .61. Whence, Fst =
.61 x 10,700,000/1000 = 6520 psi. Then
T cr = Fst 2 n r [2] t

**BUCKLING STRENGTH** **OF** **CURVED** **SHEET** **PANELS.** **ULTIMATE**

**STRENGTH** **OF** **STIFFENED CURVED SHEET STRUCTURES.**


**PART** **1.** **BUCKLING STRENGTH** **OF** **CURVED SHEET PANELS**



C9.1 Introduction.


Curved sheet panels represent a common
external part of flight vehicle structures.
EXlliTIples are the skin of the fuselage and the
missile. If the curved sheet has no longitudinal stiffeners, failure will occur when
buckling occurs. If the curved sheet has
stiffening elements attached then the composite
unit will not fail on the development of sheet
buckling, that is. the composite unit has an
ultimate strength much greater than the load
which caused initial buckling of the curved
sheet panels between the stiffening units
commonly referred to as sheet stiffeners. In
some flight vehicle designs it may be specified
that under a certain percentage of the limit
loads that no buckling of the curved sheet
panels shall occur. Thus it is necessary to be
able to determine what stresses will cause
curved sheet panels to buckle and also to
determine what external loads will cause a
stiffened sheet panel to fail.


C9. 2 State of the Theory.


In Chapter AlB, the small deflection
linear theory was used to determine the compressive buckling stress of flat sheet panels.
The theoretical results compare favorably with
experimental test results. However, when the
same theory is applied to unstiffened curved
sheet panels or thin-walled cylinders, the
theoretical results are considerably above the
test results on such units. A large deflection
theory gives closer comparison to test results,
but this theory involves a consideration of
initial imperfections in the sheet and thus an
unknown quantity. For the application of both
small and large deflection theories to the
buckling of curved sheet and cylinders, the
reader is referred to the references listed at
the end of Chapter C8, particularly those
reports which give the results of such investigators as Donnell, Batdorf and Gerard.


C9.3 Compressive Buckling Stress of Curved
Sheet Panels.


The expression for the buckling stress
under axial compression is of the same form as
for flat sheets, the value of the buckling
coefficient K c having a higher value.



Fig. C9.1 gives curves for determining the
buckling coefficient Kc . The theoretical
derived curve is shown along with the recommended design curves which were dictated by
test results. These curves apply for buckling
stresses in the elastic range.


C9.4 Shear Buckling Stress of Curved Sheet Panels.


The equation for the buckling shear stress

is,


                     - C9.2


Figs. C9.2 to C9.5 gives curves for finding
the buckling stress coefficient K s to use in
Equation C9.2. These curves apply when buckling
stresses are in the elastic range.


C9. 5 Buckling Strength of Curved Sheet Panels Under
Combined Axial Compression and Shear.


The studies by Schildcrout and Stein
(Ref. 1) gave the following interaction equation
for combined longitudinal compression and shear
on curved sheet panels:

                - - - - - - C9.3



C9.6 Compressive Buckling Stress of Curved Panels
with Internal Pressure.


As for the case of monocoque cylinders,
internal outward pressure increases the axial
buckling compressive stress of the curved sheet
panel. Rafel and Sandlin (Ref. 3) and Rafel
(Ref. 4) performed tests on curved panels under
axial compression and internal outward pressure.
The results correlate with the interaction
equation:

R C 2 + R p = 1 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - C9.5

instead of compression, then RL is considered
as a negative compression using the compression
allowable. The equation for margin of safety

In using Equation C9.5, the value of Rp

C9. 7 Shear Buckling Stress of Curved Sheet
Panels with Internal Pressure.


As in the case of monocoque cylinders,
internal pressure increases the shear buckling
stress of the curved sheet panel. Brown and
Hopkins (Ref. 5) solved the classical
equilibrium equations to determine the effect
of radially outward pressure upon the shear
buckling stress of curved panels and obtained
fair agreement with test data by Rafel and
Sandlin (Ref. 3). The test data also
correlates with the interaction curve used
for the effect of internal pressure upon
cylinders in torsion (see Chapter C8). The
interaction equation is:

C9.8 Example Problems.


PROBLEt1 1.


Fig. C9.6 illustrates a circular fuselage
section with longit~dinal stringers represented
by the small circles. The area of each
stringer is .15 sq. in. The skin thickness is
.04 inches. All material is aluminum alloy
with Ec = 10,700,000. The fuselage frame
spacing (a) is 15.75 inches. The fuselage
section is subjected to the following load
system:

My 600,000 in. lb. (causing compression on
top half)
Vz = 5175 lbs. (acting up)
T = Torsional moment = 210,000 in.lbs. (acting
counterclockwise)



----

z

Fig. C9.6


The problem is to determine whether skin
panels (A) and (B) will buckle under the given
combined loading on the fuselage section.


Solution.


To find the bending stresses, the moment
of inertia of the cross section about axis y-y
is necessary, which axis is also the neutral
axis since all material is effective. The
moment of inertia will equal 4 times that due
to material in one quadrant.


Iy due to stringers is,

Iy = 4 [.075X20"+ .15 (19.30 [2] +17.34 [2] +14.14 [2]

Consider Skin Panel (A):

The bending stress at midpoint of Panel
(A) will be calculated:


f c = MZ/ly = (600,000 x 19.7)/1725 = 6850 psi


Thus stress ratio Rc = fc/F ccr = 6850/7850


**=** **.874**


Shear stress on Panel (A) due to torsion is,


f s = T/2At, where A is inclosed area of
fuselage cell.


f s = 210,000/2 x n x 20 [2] x .04 = 2090 psi.


The panel is also subjected to shear
stress due to transverse shear of Vz = 5175 Ibs.


The shear flow equation is,

fS(total) = 269 + 2090 = 2359 psi.


**Then** **shear** **stress** **ratio** **Rs** **=** **fs/F** **Scr** **=**

The interaction equation for combined

panel will not buckle.

Consider Skin Panel (B).


Arm Z to midpoint of panel = 15.88 in.


fc = Mz/I = 600,000 x 15.88/1725 = 5520 psi


Rc = 5520/7850 = .704


The torsional shear stress is the same on
all panels or f s = 2090 psi as previously calculated.


Shear flow q due to transverse shear load:

q = f ZZA = 3 ZZA.


Calculation of ZZA at upper edge of panel:


For stringers = .075 x 20 + .15 (19.3 + 17.34)

**=** **7.0**


For skin: Area = 2 x 5.25 x .04 = .42.


Vertical distance Z to centroid of skin portion
= r sin _a/a._ _a_ = 300. The result is Z = 19.1
in. The ZA = 19.1 x .42 = 8.03. Total ZZA =
8.03 + 7.0 = 15.03. Then q = 3 ZZA = 3 x 15.03
**=** **45.09** **Ib./1n.**


A similar calculation for shear flow at
lower edge of Panel (B) would give q equal 55.0.
Thus average shear flow on panel is (55 +
45.09)/2 = 50.04. Then f s = q/t = 50.14/.04 =
1251 psi. The total shear stress f s on panel
then equals 1251 + 2090 = 3341 psi.


Rs = fs/Fscr = 3341/11200 = .299


SUbstituting in interaction equation Rc +
RS 2 = .704 + .299 2 = .793. The result is less
than 1.0, thus panel will not buckle.


The student should check other panels for
buckling and compare their margins of safety.

The shear flow will be zero on Z axis.
The shear flow at top edge of Panel (A) will
be due to effect of one-half the area of
stringer (1).


q~-2 = - 3 x .075 x 20 = - 4.5 Ib./in.


Area of skin between stringers (1) and (2)
is 5.25 x .04 = .21 = A.


Distance from centroid of Panel (A) from
neutral axis is Z = r sin _a/a._ _a_ = 15 [0 ] . which
gives Z = 19.8 in.


Thus q2_~ =- 4.5   - 3x .2L x 19.8= -17 Ib./in


Then average shear flow on panel is
(17 + 4.5)/2 = 10.75.


Then shear stress = q/t = 10.75/.04 =

This shear stress has the same sense or
direction as the torsional shear stress so we
add the two to obtain the true shear or:

BUCKLING STRENGTH OF CURVED SHEET PANELS.

C9.8 ULTIMATE STRENGTH OF STIFFENED CURVED SHEET STRUCTURES.


General Comment:


In general the compressive stress is the
dominant factor in causing the panel buckling.
Thus to increase the buckling stress of the
panels and also to give a more effective
stringer arrangement to carry the bending
moment, the stringers should be spaced closer
in the top and bottom regions of the crosssection and with increased spacing as the
neutral axis is approached.


PROBLEM 2.


The fuselage section in Problem 1 is subjected to an internal outward pressure of 5
psi. What would be the compressive buckling
stress of a panel and also the shear buckling
stress with this internal pressure existing.


Solution.


From Art. C9.6, the interaction equation
is,


**R** **C** **2** **+** **Rp** **=** **1,**


From Problem 1, the compressive buckling
stress FCcr = 7850 psi.


To evaluate Rp, the external inward radial
acting pressure that would cause buckling of a
circular cylinder having a radius equal to that
of the curved sheet panel must be determined.
Use is made of Fig. C8.16 of Chapter C8 to
determine the backing stress under such a
loading. The lower scale parameter for Fig.
C8.16 is,


= 20 x 15.75 .04 [2]  - ~~/1~~  - .3 ~~[2]~~ = 296


From Fig. C8.16, we read Ky = 19

The external radial pressure to produce
this buckling stress is,


p = Fccrt/r = 1215 x .04/20 = 2.43 psi


Rp = 25.~ = 2.06



11200 psi. The value of Rp is determined as
above or Rp = 2.06. Subt. in interaction
equation:


f s [2] = 11200 [2] (3.06), or f s = 19500 psi.


The internal pressure of 5 psi thus increases the shear buckling stress from 11200 to
19500 psi.

C9.9 Introduction.


A cylindrical structure composed of a thin
skin covering and stiffened by longitudinal
stringers and transverse frames or rings is a
common type of structure for airplane fuselages,
missiles and various types of space vehicles,
and such structures are often referred to as
the semi-monocoque type of structure. The
design of a semi-monocoque structure involves
the solution of two major problems, namely, the
stress distribution in the structure under
various external loadings and the check of the
structure to see if these _stresses_ _can be_ safely
and efficiently carried by individual components
of the structure as well as the structure acting
as a whole.

In general, thin curved sheet panels buckle
under relatively low compressive stress and
thus if design requirements specified no
buckling of the sheet under limit or design
loads, the sheet would have to be relatively
thick or the stringers placed very close together and the fuselage or body structure
would be unsatisfactory from a strength weight
standpoint, In missile structures, internal
pressurization increases the buckling stress
greatly, thus the buckling weakness of thin
sheet is improved, but keeping a structure
pressurized under all operating conditions has
its difficulties.


In a semi-monocoque body, the longitudinal
stringers provide efficient resistance to
compressive stresses and buckled sheet panels
can transfer shear loads by diagonal tension
field action, thus the buckling of the sheet
panels is not an important factor in limiting
the ultimate strength of the over-all
structural unit. When buckling of the skin
panels takes place, a stress redistribution
over the entire structure takes place, thus it
is important to know when skin buckling begins.
Furthermore, design requirements may often
specify that no skin buckling should take
place under a certain percent of the limit or
design loads. The equations and design curves
in Part 1 of this chapter can be used to
determine the buckling stress of curved sheet
panels under various stress systems.


(2) Panel Instability.


The internal rings or frames in a semimonocoque structure such as a fuselage divide
the longitudinal stringers and their attached
skin into lengths called panels. If these
frames are sUfficiently rigid, a semi-monocoque
structure if sUbjected to bending will fail on
the compression side as illustrated in Fig.
C9.7a. The stringers act as columns with an
effective length equal to the panel length
which is the ring spacing. Initial failure thus
occurs in a single panel and thus is referred
to as a panel instability failure. In general,
this type of failure occurs in most practical
aircraft and aerospace semi-monocoque
structures because the rings are sufficiently
stiff to promote this type of failure. Since
the inside of a fuselage carries various loads,
such as passengers, cargo, etc., the rings must
act as structural units to transfer such loads
to the shell skin, thus requiring rings of
considerable strength and stiffness. Even
lightly loaded frames must be several inches
deep to provide conduits required in various
installations to pass through the web of the
ring cross-section, thus providing a relatively
stiff ring for supporting the stiffeners in
their column action, When the skin buckles
under shear and compressive stresses, the skin



C9.9


panels transfer further shear forces by semidiagonal tension field action which produces
additional axial loads in stringers and also
bending which must be considered in arriving
at the panel failing strength. This subject
is treated in detail in Part 2 of Chapter Cll.


(3) General Instability.


In general instability, failure is not
confined to the region between two adjacent
frames or rings but may extend over a distance
of several frame spacings as illustrated in
Fig. C9.7b for a stiffened cylindrical shell
in bending. In panel instability, the transverse stiffeners provided by the frames on
rings is sufficient to enforce nodes in the
stringers at the frame support points as
illustrated in Fig, C9.7a. Any additional
stiffeners in excess of this amount does not
contribute to additional buckling strength.
General instability may thus occur when the
stiffeners of the supporting frames is less
than this minimum value.


C9. 11 The Determination of the Stresses in a
Stiffened Cylindrical Structure Under
External Loads.


The stresses in a stiffened cylindrical
structure such as used in typical fuselage or
missile design can be fairly accurately
determined by the modified beam theory as presented in Chapter A20. A more rigorous approach
is given in Chapter AS involving matrix formulation but this approach requires the use of a
large electronic computor to handle the required
calculations. For details of applying the
modified beam theory, the reader should refer
to Articles A20.3 and A20.4 of Chapter A20.
In the example problem solution as given in
Article A20.4, the effective area to use for
the curved sheet was based on the ratio of the
buckling stress of the curved panel to the
bending compressive stress on the panel due to
bending of the entire effective cross-section
of the fuselage under the design loads. In the
example problem as given in Table A20.2, a
conservative buckling compressive stress equal
to .3 Et/r was used for the curved panel and no
consideration of the effect of shear stress on
the compressive buckling stress was considered,


A more accurate procedure would be to calCUlate the effective area of the curved panels
taking into account the influence of combined
compression and shear on the buckling strength
of the panel, Thus in Table A20.2 on page A20.5
of Chapter A20, the shear stress on each curved
panel should also be calculated and then the
buckling stress of the panel under the combined
compression and shear calculated.

and shear should be calculated using Equations
C9.1 and C9.8. The buckling stress under
combined compression and shear is given by the
interaction equation:

Rc + RS [2] = 1, where Rc = fc/F ccr ' Rs = fs/F scr 

The expression for margin of safety is,


2



1'1.8.



= R c + _..j_ R c 2 + 4R s 2 - 1



Let f c be the compressive stress that will
buckle the curved sheet panel when sUbjected to
combined compression and shear when the ratio
of the applied compressive and shear stresses
in a constant. Then,


2
f C a f c (R C + _..j_ Rc2 + 4R s 2 ) - C9.6


These f c values should then replace the
values in column 5 of Table A20.2.


The author has noted that one aerospace
company in their missile design uses only 90
percent of the theoretical buckling stress in
computing the effective area of the buckled
curved panels. This correction assumes that
the curved sheet fails to hold the buckling
stress as the fuselage section as a whole is
further loaded and the curved sheet SUffers
more buckling distortion.


C9. 12 Panel Instability Strength.


Panel instability means failure of the
stringer and its effective skin between two
adjacent frames. The bending of the stiffened
shell as a whole produces a compressive load
Or stress on the stringer. The semi-tension
field action of the skin after buckling
produces an additional compressive load on the
stringer and also a bending moment.


The compressive stress due to bending of
the stiffened shell as a whole is found by the
methods discussed in Article C9.11. The
additional stringer loads due to semi-tension
field action are determined by the theory and
procedure given in Part 2 of Chapter Cll.


These calculated stringer loads are then
compared to the stringer strength to determine
whether a positive margin of safety eXists.
The local crippling and column strength of a
stringer plus its effective skin can be found
by the theory and analysis methods given in
Chapter C7. The bending strength of the
stringer cross-section can be found by the
theory and analysis method given in Chapter C3.
The strength of the stringer in combined
compression and bending is found by use of the
proper interaction equation.



C9.11


C9.13 Calculation of General Instability.


A great deal of theoretical and experimental work has been done on the subject of
general instability of stiffened shells. The
general goal in the design of such structures
is to insure the frames have sufficient
stiffness so as to prevent the type of failure
illustrated in Fig. C9.7b or, in other words,
to insure the type of failure illustrated in
Fig. C9.7a which is panel instability.


Shanley (Ref. 6) has derived an expression
for the required frame stiffness to prevent
general instability failure of a stiffened shell
in pure bending.


(EI) f = Cf 1'1D 2/L


In a study of available test data, Cf was
found to be 1/16000. Thus,



(EI )f = 1'1D 2/ 16 00 0L


where, E = modulus of elasticity




- - - - C9.7



I = moment of inertia of frame section


D = diameter of stiffened shell

L = frame spacing


1'1 = bending moment on shell


Becker (Ref. 7) in a comprehensive study
of most published theoretical and experimental
material relative to the general instability of
stiffened shells, summarizes the results of his
stUdies as given in Table C9.1.


Bending.


For the case of bending, the constant of
4.80 in the equation given in Table C9.1 is for
the condition where the frames are attached to
the skin between the stringers. For frames not
attached to the skin between stringers, the
constant should be 3.25.


The effective sheet width for use with the
stringers may be found from the equation,

For the frames the effective skin width
should be taken as the total frame spacing (d).
For inelastic stresses, the use of the secant
modules appears to be applicable on the basis
of limited test data.


External Radial or Hydrostatic Pressure.


The effective skin width to be used in
computing the stringer and frame section
properties may be determined from the following
equation.


The subscript s refers to stringer and f
refers to frame. The term d is the frame
spacing.


Torsion.


The effective skin to be used can be
determined from the following equation:

where Fs cr is the shear buckling stress
for the curved skin panel. Fst, the torsional
shear stress at torsional general instability
(pSi) .


The equations for torsion as given in
Table C9.1 would not apply to shells in which
there is a strong tension field that could
introduce appreciable secondary stresses in
the frame. The reader should refer to Part 2
of Chapter Cll for a treatment of this subject
involving the effect of semi-tension field
action in the skin panels.


Transverse Shear General Instability.


From Ref. 7, it is stated that a conservative shear general instability shearing
stress may be made by utilizing the relation.


Fs = 0.85 Fst C9.11


where Fs is the transverse shear stress under
transverse shear general instab.lli ty .


General Instability in Combined Torsion and
Bending.


From (Ref. 7) the following interaction
relation may be used to compute the permissible
combinations of applied torsion and bending
moments to a stiffened cylinder.

where M = applied moment


Mo = moment causing bending general instability acting alone

T = applied torsional moment


To = torsional moment causing torsional

General Instability in Combined Transverse
Shear and Bending.


(Ref. 7) concludes there is no interaction
for this combination of transverse shear and
bending loads. General instability occurs only
for either type of loading acting alone and thus
both loadings may be examined separately.

Available test data on practical shells
show this theoretical buckling stress to be
much too high. Thus to satisfy experimental

CIO. I Introduction.


The analysis and design of a metal beam
composed of flange members riveted or spotwelded to web members is a frequent problem in
airplane structural design. In thiS chapter,
the general theory for beams with non-buckling
webs is considered. In Chapter Cll, the more
common case where the beam web wrinkles and
goes over into a semi-tension field condition
is considered. The advantages and disadvantages
of the non-buckling and the buckling or semitension field web are discussed in Chapter Cll.
The general beam theory as given in this chapter
is basic to that given in Chapter Cll, thus the
student should study this chapter before Cll.



gyration of the beam section as large as possible,
and at the same time maintain a flange section
which will have a high local crippling or crushing stress. Furthermore, the flange sections
for large cantilever beams which are frequently
used in wing design should be of such shape as
to permit efficient tapering or reducing of the
section as the beam extends outboard. This
tapering of section should also be considered
from a fabrication or machining standpoint. The
most efficient flange from a strength/weight
standpoint might be very costly or entirely
impractical from a fabrication and assembly
standpoint.

metal covered wing construction. Sections (a),
(b), (c) and (d) are typical beam flange
sections for wide box beams where additional
stringers or skin stiffeners are also used to
provide bending resistance. These flange
sections are generally of the extruded type
although such sections as (b) and (c) are
frequently made from sheet stock. These flange
sections are almost always used with a beam web
composed of flat Sheet, which is stiffened by
vertical stiffeners riveted or spot-welded to
the web or stiffened by beads or flanged
lightening holes.


Figs. (e) and (f) illustrate two types of
flange sections used in truss beams which land
themselves readily to connection With truss web
members. Beam flange sections (g) and (h) are
typical sections for wing construction in which
no additional spanwise stringers are used. In
section (g) tapering of sectional area is provided by first omitting the reinforcing plates,
and then gradually decreasing the extruded
shape by machining until only a small angle
remains. In section (h) a gradual decrease in
section area is produced by milling out the
center portion to form an H section and then
cutting this section down finally to a simple
angle.


CIO.3 Allowable Flange Design Stresses


The calculating of the stresses in the beam
flanges is in general not a difficult procedure
if the usual assumptions are made in the flexure
theory. The question as to what flange stresses
will cause failure is the difficult one from a
theoretical standpoint. The only sure way to
determine the design allowable is to make
sufficient static tests of specially designed
test beams.


For beam sections as illustrated in Fig.
CIO.l, the following tests are usually necessary
for forming the basis of design allowable
stresses.


(1) A test subjecting the beam to pure
bending.


(2) A test of a short length of beam in
bending so that failure will occur in web
instead of flange.


(3) A test of a short length of beam in
pure compression to obtain local crippling
strength.


(4) Several tests of beams in combined
bending and compression, using different ratios
of bending to compressive loads.


Enough data from the above tests can
usually be obtained to give rather complete
allowable stress curves for the design of the



beam. For the approximate design of beam
flanges, the method given in this chapter can
be used.


The beam flange sections (a), (b), (c) and
(d) of Fig. CIO.2 are stabilized by the sheet
covering and also by the beam web; thus compressive tests of short lengths to obtain crippling
stress, and a test of a length equal to the wing
rib spacing should give sufficient information
on which to base design allowables. Several
lengths of the flange section for the truss type
of beam should be tested in compression to
obtain the column curve since the distance
between panel points of the truss will vary.


Before designing any test beams, the
structural designer would like to know approximately what his proposed beam flange sections
will carry from a stress standpoint, since it
is desirable to make test specimens closely
approximate to the sections to be finally used
in the completed structure. For most of the
sections of Fig. CIO.2, the ultimate stresses
can be calculated approximately by the methods
of Chapter C7. For heavy sections similar to
(g) and (h) of Fig. CIO.2, where the Ultimate
stresses fall far above the yield strength of
the material, and where some parts of the
section buckle before other parts, and also
where two different kinds of material are used
in the same flange section, a logical procedure
in trying to calculate Ultimate strength of the
section would be to make use of the stressstrain diagrams of the materials.


CIO.4 Use of Stress-Strain Diagrams in Computing Beam
Flange Bending Allowable Design Stresses.


In the beam type of wing construction,
where the flange material is concentrated over
the web members instead of distributed over the
surface in the form of stringers, the allowable
ultimate compressive stress which can be
developed is considerably above the yield
strength of the material since the flange is
composed of a section with thick elements which
promotes a high crippling stress and since the
beam flange is stabilized in both vertical and
horizontal directions by the web and skin covering respectively, the influence of column action
is negligible. Fig. (a) illustrates this type
of beam. The general flexure formula assumes
that stress is proportional to s train which is
correct for stresses below the proportional
limit of the beam material, but the ultimate
resisting stresses for the flange 0 f a beam such
as in Fig. (a) is far above the proportional
limit, thus the actual stress distribution is
more like the dashed line in Fig. (b) instead
of the triangular distribution as assumed in the
common beam theory. Thus to obtain beam fiber
stresses above the proportional limit, it is
necessary to consider strain and the stress
which accompanies such a strain, which relation

shIp can be obtaIned from the stress-straIn
dIagram of the materIal. A straIght lIne
dIstrIbutIon for straIn, that Is, plane sectIons
remaIns plane after bendIng Is a reasonable one,
and verIfIed by tests.


In a beam In bendIng, one sIde Is In
tensIon and the other In compressIon. The
tensIle and compressIve stress-straIn dIagrams
for materials lIke aluminum alloy are dIfferent
above the proportIonal lImIt, and the same unIt
strain will cause dIfferent stresses on the two
sIdes of the beam. In frequent cases of large
beam desIgn, the beam flange may be composed of
two kInds of materIal and certaIn portIons for
attachIng to skin or web may buckle before the
Ultimate strength of the section as a whole is
obtaIned. The solution for the ultImate
internal resistIng moment for such a beam requires that consideratIon be given to the
stress-straIn dIagram of the various materials
and unIts makIng up the beam sectIon. ThIs
general method of approach in studyIng the
UltImate internal resIstIng moment of a beam
sectIon can best be explaIned by an example
problem.


Example Problem


FIg. C10.3 shows the cross-sectIon of a

be&~ in a metal covered wIng. The main flange
members are composed of heavy 24ST extruded
shapes. The extrusIons are reinforced by 24SRT
sheet strIps. The beam web is made from 24ST
alclad materIal. The problem Is to calculate
the ultimate Internal resistIng moment for this
beam sectIon.


FIg. C10.4 shows the stress-straIn dIagram
for these varIous materIals. The 1/8 Inch thick
outstandIng legs of the extrusIons act as a
plate stiffened on three sIdes and free on the
fourth. These legs wIll buckle at a stress of
35,000 psI in compressIon as determined by the
methods gIven In Chapter C7. The stress-strain
dIagram of the two outstandIng legs wIll be
horIzontal at 35,000 psI as shown In Fig. C10.4.
Although the legs buckle, they wIll tend to
hold the bucklIng stress under farther flange
strain. In Fig. C10.5, each beam section has
been broken down Into narrow horizontal strIps
desIgnated from (a) to (w). Only that portion
of the web In way of flange has been consIdered
In thIs example. FIg. C10.5a shows the straIn
dIstributIon assumed for the trial solutIon. A
heavy aluminum alloy sectIon In compressIon will



C10.3


usually fall at a strain between .008 to .01
Inch per inch if column faIlure Is prevented.
In Fig. C10.5a, the compressIve unIt straIn at
the upper beam fiber has been taken as .008"/".
The neutral axIs of the sectIon has been
assumed at 1.25" above center lIne of beam.
TakIng zero strain at thIs poInt the beam
sectIon strain diagram is as shown in FIg.
C10.5a.


For eqUilIbrIum the total compressIve bendIng stresses above the neutral axIs must equal
the total tensIle bendIng stresses below the
neutral axis.


Tables C10.l and C10.2 gIve the detaIl
calculations for calculatIng the resIstIng
moment. The bendIng unIt stress In column (5)
is obtaIned from Fig. C10.4 usIng the unit
strain in column (4). If the summatIon of
column (6) In each Table Is the same, the
assumed locatIon of the neutral axis Is correct.
The total ultImate resIstIng moment for thIs
sectIon equals 1032000 + 1360110 = 2393000 In.
lb. UsIng the ordInary beam formula wIth
propertIes about the geometrIc neutral axIs as
given In FIg. C10.3 and takIng extreme fIber
stresses of 46000 and 52000 psI which correspond to stresses as per straIn dIagram of FIg.
C10.5a, the Internal resIstIng moment would
equal, M = f I/c = 46000 x 436/969 = 2070000
in. lb. as compared to 2392000 In. lb. by the
more logical solutIon, whIch Is a dIfference of
16 percent. The discrepancy would stIll be
larger If the outstandIng leg (a) dId not
buckle, sInce the more exact solutIon only
allowed 35000 psI on thIs element whereas the
general beam formula stresses It to 46000 psI.


TrIal and Error Approach



The locatIon of the neutral axIs Is unknown, thus the calCUlatIons In Tables C10.l and
2 are for the final assumptIon whIch Is the true
locatIon of the neutral
axis. The general procedure would be as
follows: Assume neutral 2nd Trial N. A.

CIO.5



In many cases, such as a frame in a
fuselage, the inner flange of the frame crosssection is free from a lateral brace, thus
provisions must be taken to brace the flange
laterally or the flange must be designed for
lateral column action. This subject is discussed further in Chapter D3.


CIO.6 Web strength. Stable Webs.


A stable web beam is one that carries its
design load without buckling of the web, or in
other words it remains in its initially flat
condition. The design shear stress is not
greater than the buckling shear stress for the
individual web panels and the web stiffeners
have sufficient stiffness to keep the web from
buckling as a whole.


In general, a thin web beam with web
stiffeners designed for non-buckling is not
used widely in flight vehicle structures as
its strength/weight ratio is relatively poor.
In bUilt-in or integral fuel tanks, it is often
desirable to have the beam webs and the skin
undergo no buckling or wrinkling under the
design loads in order to give better insurance
against leaking along riveted web panel
boundaries.


The student should realize that the
buckling web stress is not a failing stress as
the web will take more before collapse of the
web takes place, thus in ~eneral the web is not
loaded to its full capacity for taking load
and the web stiffeners are only designed for
sufficient stiffness to prevent web buckling
and not for the full failing strength of the
web.


Equation for Web Buckling Shear Stress


Equation C5.5 of Chapter C5 gives the
buckling stress of a flat sheet panel under
shear loads. The equation is

_ 71 s n'" k s E t 2
F Scr - 12(1- Vela) (1)) - -- (CIO.l)


The curves of Fig. C5.13 and C5.11 of
Chapter C5 are used to solve this equation and
the reader should refer to Art. C5.8 of Chapter
C5 for a review of sheet buckling under shear
loads.


Equation for Web Buckling Bending stress


If the web does not buckle it will be
sUbjected to longitudinal bending stresses of
compression and tension With zero stress at the
beam neutral axis. Thus in general, the beam
is subjected to a combined shear and bending
stress system.



Since the term _J_ ydA is maximum for a
section at the neutral axis, the shearing stress
in a beam will be maximum at the neutral axis.
In general, the webs of aircraft beams are
relatively thin; thus the term _J_ ydA for the
web is qUite small so that the shearing stress
intensity over the web is approximately uniform.
Thus a simple formula f s = V/hb has been widely
used for calculating the maximum web shearing
stress. In this equation h is a distance which
will make the shear stress f s check the maximum
value of the shear stress as given by equation
CIO.5.


A simple consideration of the internal
stresses on a small element cut from a beam in
bending and shear will indicate what value of
h to use in the simplified shear equation fs =
V/hb.


Fig. CIO.6a shows a beam element of length
dx cut from a beam which is subjected to a

bending buckling stress. It is,

In solving this equation, Figs. C5.15 and

Buckling of Web Panels Under

combined bending and shear is,

CIO.7 Web Bending and Shear Stresses.


Since the web is designed not to buckle
under the design loads, the web will be effective
in taking bending stresses and the following well
known equation applies.



fb = My/Ix

where Ix is the moment of inertia of the beam
section and the web is included.

known flexural shear stress equation was derived,
namely,

bending moment which produces compression on
the upper portion. The bending moment on
section (AB) is M and on section (CD) M + ~,
thus the vectors representing the stress on
face (CD) are drawn longer than on face (AB).
The beam element is also sUbjected to a total
shear force V on each face. C a and C 1
represent the resultant of the total compressive
forces on each face and T a and T 1 the resultant
of the tensile stresses. Fig. (b) shows the
same free body but with the tensile and
compressive stresses on each face replaced by
a simple force C and T which tends to move the
block with the same results as the system of
Fig. (a). In Fig. (c) the beam element of Fig.
(b) has been cut along the neutral axis, and a
force applied to the cut faces equal to f s bdx,
where f s equals the horizontal shear stress
intensity.


Writing the equilibrium equation, that the
sum of the horizontal forces on the upper
portion must equal zero, we obtain


C - fs bdx = 0, hence C = f s bdx


and likewise for the lower T + f s bdx = 0,
hence T = fs bdx.


Fig. (d) shows the free body of Fig. (b),
but with C and T replaced by their above
equivalent values.


Taking moments about point (0)


MO = f s bdx • h - Vdx = 0, hence


V
f s = bh (ClO.6)


Thus to obtain a value fs equal to the
maximum value given by equation (a) use an
effective arm (h) equal to the distance between



the bending stress centroids. For a rectangular
section the effective arm is obviously equal to
2/3 the beam height, but for the common beam
sections as illustrated in Figs. CIO.II or CIO.12,
the distance between bending stress centroids
is not so obvious particularly if the web is
considered effective in bending. A close
approximation of the effective arm (h) and a
procedure which is common practice is to assume
(h) equal to the distance between the centroids
of the web-flange rivets. The student should
take several example beam sections and check
this assumption for (h) using Eq. (CIO.6)
against the exact values by Eq. (CIO.5).


Some structural designers make assumptions
as to the proportion of the total vertical beam
shear which is carried by the beam web. For
example, it is sometimes assumed that the web
takes the entire beam shear, or it may take only
90 percent. The percentage of the shear load
carried by the web depends of course upon the
size of the flange sections and the form of the
web section. For example, in Fig. CIO.?, the
same flange is connected by a web which is
attached to the flanges in two ways as illustrated in Figs. (a) and (b). In Fig. (a), the
shear flow on portions (AB) and (CD) help resist
the external shear, whereas the shear flow on
these portions in Fig. (b) act in the same
direction as the external shear load; thus
causing the shear load on the web to be greater
than the external shear load. (See Chapter Al4
and Al5 for general discussion of shear flow in
open and closed sections).

ClO.8 Shear Resistance Provided by Sloping Flanges.


A large majority of the beams in airplane
wing and tail surfaces have sloping flanges because of the taper of the structure in both
planform and thickness. This sloping of the
beam flanges relieves the beam web of considering shear load and should not be neglected.
Fig. CIO.S shows a beam (abcd) carrying a load
system P 1, P a, etc. The top flange is sloping
as shown. If both flanges were extended, they
would intersect at point (0).

Then C = Th = M/h (h = distance between flange
stress centroids)


The vertical component Tv of the load T in
the upper flange equals Th h/Lo, but Th = M/h,
hence


Tv = M....!!..- = J1..
h LO LO

Let VF = shear load carried by beam flanges


Then VF = MILO - - - - - - - - - - - - (C10.7)


Thus the shear component carried by the
axial loads in the sloping flange members equals
the bending moment at the section being considered divided by the distance from the section
to the point of intersection (0) of the flanges.


The above derivation was based on the
assumption that the entire resisting moment M
was developed by the flanges. With the web
effective in bending, the moment developed by
the web should be subtracted from the total
bending moment M.


Let I = IF1. + IWeb

IWeb
The moment developed by web = M --1-
where


M = total bending moment on section


In airplane construction the centilever
beam with sloping flange members is the common
case, and the shear resistance by the flange
axial loads is an important factor which should
not be neglected if an efficient structure is
desired from a strength-weight standpoint.


CI0.9 Effect of Variable Moment of Inertia on

Flexural Shear Stress Distribution.


The fundamental shear stress equation C10.5
as derived in Chapter A14 applies strictly to
beams of constant moment of inertia. For airplane beams the common case is one with variable
moment of inertia; thus the stresses obtained by
equation C10.5 are incorrect, although the
discrepancy in most cases is not large. The
student should realize this fact in studying
the shear flow picture in tapered wing
structures. 8ee Art. A15.15 of Chapter A15.



CI0.7


CI0.9a Flange Discontinuities.


From a weight saving standpoint, it is
necessary to taper flange sections in order to
approach a beam of constant strength relative
to the applied loads.


Fig. a illustrates how such tapering of
the flange section may produce local eccentric
flange loads. Between sections (1) and (2) the
upper flange tapers in side view as shown which

displaces the flange neutral axis as shown.
Assuming there is no change in bending moment
over the beam portion as shown, the force F
must be greater than F since resisting ann d
is less than d. For equilibrium this moment
due to F~ and F not being colinear must be
balanced in some manner. If the flanges are
rigidly connected to web and stiffeners, this
moment can be balanced by an additional shear
stress on the web panel between points (1, 2,
3 and 4) as illustrated in Fig. b. Thus in
cases of rather abrupt changes in flange
sections which produce the eccentricity as
illustrated the web and stiffeners should be
checked for the additional shear flow load on
the web. If such displacements in the flange
neutral axis occur in the plan view, the skin
covering should be investigated for the
additional shearing stresses.


CI0.I0 Stiffener Size to Use with Non-Buckling
Web.


A web stiffener is used to decrease the
size of web panel; thus when buckling of the
web starts, the stiffener tends to keep buckles
from extending across the stiffener or causes
the sheet to buckle in two panels instead of
one. Mr. H. Wagner in a paper presented before
a meeting of the A.8.M.E. in 1930 offered the
following expression as the required moment of
inertia of a stiffener to be used With a shear
resistant web.

v = vertical shear at section


t = web thickness

E = modulus of elasticity


A more recent criteria for stiffener
stiffness (Iv) for both flat and curved webs
is given by the curve in Fig. C10.9. When the
stiffener is used purely as such and not as a
means to transfer a concentrated external load
to the beam web, the question arises as to what
is the minimum number of fasteners required in
attaching the stiffener to the web. For nonbuckling webs, two criteria are suggested:

(1) The stiffener should be attached to the
flange at each end.


(2) The rivet pitch (spacing) should according
to (Ref. 1) be at the most equal to 1/4
times the stiffener spacing, or 1/4 the
web height if this is smaller, in order
to justify the assumption of simple support
at the edges of the web panel. Normal
practice uses more rivets.


CIO. 11 Notes on Beam Rivet Design.


Except for very small beam sections which
may be extruded as one piece, the usual beam



consists of separate web and flange members,
fastened together by rivets, bolts, spot welding
or continuous welding. In the design of such
beams it is thus necessary to know what loads
the rivets, bolts, etc., are subjected to in
order to provide the proper connective strength.
It is qUite easy to substitute in simple formulas
to find the loads on beam flange rivets, however, the student should be sure that he understands the fundamental beam action behind these
formulas.


Fig. C10.10 illustrates a beam portion
equal in length to the flange rivet pitch p.
The beam section at (AA') is subjected to a
bending moment M and M + ~ at section (CC').
The bending stress distribution on the beam
faces is indicated by the stress triangles. In
this example section it will be assumed that the

~p,b takes no bending stresses.


Let PF equal the total pUll on the flange
angles due to bending stresses at section AB due
to bending moment M. Then total pull on flange
angles at section CD due to a moment M + ~ on
beam section CC' equals PF + ~PF.


Under the action of these two forces the
flange angles would move to the left, but this
movement is prevented by the rivet which ties

II make the simplified equation (C10.ll), check the

11 II exact result as given by equation (C10.12), the
II distance (h) would have to be greater than the
II distance between the flange stress centroids.

CtO. t2 Loads on Rivets Attaching Reinforcing Plates to
Flange Member.


The beam flange is commonly composed of a
main unit plus several reinforcing plates or
parts which are held to the main unit by rivets
or spot welds. Fig. C10.ll illustrates typical
beam flanges. The basic section of the upper
flange is reinforced by the plates (a) and (b),
and the lower flange by the plates (c) and (d).
The purpose of the rivets is to keep the reinforcing plates from sliding along the flange tee
section due to the bending of the beam; thus
making the plates effective in bending. This
horizontal force tending to slide reinforcing
plates and which is prevented by the rivets in
shear is given by the fundamental shear flow
equation (C10.12), namely


q .. T V _J_ ydA, which



![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-763-0.png)



Fig. CtO. to



the flange angles to the web. Thus load on
rivet equals ~PF' The same reasoning applies
to the rivet holding the bottom flange angles
to the web.


The beam portion of Fig. C10.10 as a whole
is in equilibrium under the bending stresses
and the shear load V on each face.


Taking moments about the intersection of
the lower flange bending load and the beam face
CC',


[PF - (PF + ~PF)J hI + Vp = 0 - - - - (C10.9)


hence,


(C10.10)


Equation C10.10 says that the change in
flange axial load in a distance p equals the
vertical shear on beam times rivet pitch p
divided by the distance between flange bending
stress centroids. ~PF is also the horizontal
shear flow produced by flange angles over a
length of p. The horizontal shear (q) per inch
due to flange would be



![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-763-1.png)



q = V/h'



(C10.ll)



Fig. ctO.tt



The general expression for shear flow (see
chapter A14) is,


q = _YJ_ ydA   - - - - - - - - - - (C10.12)
I

Eq. (C10.ll) is easier to use since the
terms I and _J_ ydA of Eq. (C10.12) are not required, and the distance h can be estimated
closely without calculation, and will be greater
than the distance between the ventroids of the
flange areas.


Equation (C10.ll) was derived on the
assumption that the beam web took no bending
stresses. In general this is not true or only
partially true. With the web taking bending,



equals the horizontal
shear per inch along the b b
beam. To find the load
or rivet section 1-1 of
the upper flange of Fig.
C10.ll, the term _J_ ydA
equals the area of the
plate (a) times the
distance from its
centroid to the neutral
axis. For shear load
on rivet at section (2-2),
the term _J_ ydA equals the
area of plate (b) times
distance to neutral axis.
On the lower flange rivet Fig. ctO.tt
section (3-3) is critical
since both reinforcing plates are on same side,
and the entire shear flow produced by plates
(c) and (d) must be resisted by rivet section
(3-3). The term _J_ ydA would thus equal area of
both plates times the distance to the neutral
axis of the beam.



A simplified method which yields good results is based on the relative areas of the
units of the total flange. To design connection
of flange to beam web, the total horizontal
shear q produced by entire flange is always
necessary and involves the use of the entire
flange area in the shear flow calculation


V
q = I _J_ ydA.

CI0.I0 DESIGN OF METAL BEAMS. WEB SHEAR RESISTANT (NON-BUCKLING) TYPE.



The shear flow produced by a reinforcing
plate is then taken as proportional to the area
of the plate over the total flange area times
the total flange shear flow. Using simplified
equation (C10.ll), we can write


V a p
q = 11' AF - - - - - - - - - - - - - - (C10.13)


where


ap = area of plates under consideration

AF = total area of flange

q = load per inch on rivet

V and hI same as explained before


For rivet loads in beams with sloping
flanges the shear V is the net shear as
explained before in discussing web shear
stresses.


CI0. 13 Web Splices.


Usually in designing a sheet girder beam,
it is necessary from a weight saving standpoint
to use several web sheet thicknesses, which
means web splices. Fig. ClO.12 illustrates
typical web splices. Fig. (a) is typical for a

comparatively heavy web which prevents joggling
of web as in the case of Fig. (b). In the case
of Fig. (b), the lap is usually made under a
web stiffener which provides a support for the
web in driving the rivets through the thin web
sheets.


Loads on Web Splice Rivets


The web is subjected to shear loads and for
stable webs, the web undergoes bending stresses.


For rivet design it is usually assumed that
the web shear stress is constant over the depth.
Thus the vertical component of load on each web
splice rivet is the same or



RV = ~ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - (C10.14)


where


V = net web shear


n = number of rivets in splice. If butt
splice, n, equals the number of rivets
on one side of splice.


In bending the splice rivets must transfer
the bending moment due to the bending moment M
developed by the web. The largest rivet load
on a rivet due to bending will be on the most
remote rivet, e.g., rivet (a) at distance ra
from center of rotation of the rivet group.
Then load on this rivet due to web moment equals

= ~ra
R rna ~r" - - - - - - - - - - - (C10.15)


where


~r" = moment of rivet group which equals
the sum of the squares of the distances of the
rivets from the center of rotation of bolt

group.


The resultant load on the critical rivet
will equal the vector sum of the values of
equations (ClO.14) and (15).


Since in most cases only two rows of rivets
are used in a web splice, a close approximation
for the moment load on critical rivet can be
written by using the vertical distances (y) to
the rivets instead of the radial distances (r),
the resulting force acting in the horizontal
direction. Hence


MwYa
Rm a - ~y" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - (ClO.16)


The resultant combined load on critical
rivet is


R = _j_ R v " a + R ma " (CIO.l?)


The stUdent should review Chapter DI for
more detailed information on rivet loads due to
moment loads on riveted connections.


When the web of one beam is joined to that
of another beam using shear "clips," a special
problem may sometimes arise regarding the
adequacy of the clips. This design problem is
discussed in Chapter D3.


CI0. 14 Example Rivet Problem.


Fig. C10.13 shows the cross-section of a
riveted beam. If the design vertical shear on
the section is 3000 lb., check the strength of
the riveted connection. .

. Solution:


The loads on the rivets will be calculated
by the "exact" and also by the simplified
approximate equations.


The exact shear flow equation is


q=~/YdA


The first step will be the calculation of
the moment of inertia of the beam section about
the neutral axis. The bending loads are such
as to put the upper fl~nge in compression.


The moment of inertia will be calculated
about the centerline axis of the beam section
and then transferred to the neutral axis. Table
C10.3 gives the detailed calculations.

hence

The web is attached to angles by 1/8

acting in double shear.


From Chapter Dl:

C10.15 Example Problem. Strength Check of Beam.


Fig. CIO.14 shows a built up (I) section
beam, simply supported and carrying its three
concentrated loads as shown as the design load
for the beam.


Check on Bending Strength of Beam


Since the beam cross-section is constant,
the critical section is at the midpoint of the
beam where the bending moment is:


~ax = 3750 x 50 - 2400 x 25 = 127500 in.l~


As indicated in Fig. CIO.14, the beam is
riveted to the sheet covering. On the upper
flange which is in compression under the given
loading, a certain effective sheet Width will
act with the beam flange. This effective
sheet Width depends upon the beam flange stress
which is unknown as yet. As a preliminary
value, the assumption that a Width of skin
sheet equal to 30 t as acting With each rivet
line is a reasonable one. On the tension or
bottom side, the entire skin sheet is effective
or 2 inches to each side of the beam which is
the distance half way to the first skin
stiffener on each side.


Fig. CIO.15 shows the details of the
effective cross-section at midspan of the beam.
Three rivet holes are assumed in the tension
flange. Table CIO.4 shows the calculations for
the section properties, first about centerline
reference axis, then transferred to the neutral
axis.


Bending stress at midpoint of horizontal
leg of upper angles:- IN.A. = 10.44.


fb = MY/I = 127500 x 3.614/10.44 = 44200 psi

skin effective Width w will be checked. From

Since 30t or 0.75 inches was assumed for
w, the error is quite small and no revision is
necessary.


Calculation of Allowable Failing Compressive
Stress for Flange.


Since the flange is braced in two
directions at right angles to each other by the
skin and the web, column action is prevented
and the allowable stress will be the crippling
stress of the flange unit.


Chapter C7 gives methods of calculating
the crippling stress. In this example problem
the Needham method will be used and the
crippling stress for a single angle will be
calculated.


b'
t; = (.75   - 3/64)/3/32 = 7.55


From Fig. C7.5 of Chapter C7, we obtain


Fcs/V FcyEc = .068


For 2014-T6 Ext., F cy = 57000, Ec =
10,700,000.


Whence F cs = .068 x V 57000 x 10,700,000 =

53,000 psi


Since the angle legs which attach to web
are riveted together, the crippling stress for
these legs would be higher than for the angle
legs connecting to the skin, thus the value of
53,000 is somewhat conservative.


The margin of safety for the upper flange
is (53,000/44,200) - 1 = .20.


Check of Bottom Flange Tensile Strength:

fb = My/I = 127,500 x 4.35/10.44 =


53,000 psi


The material for lower skin = 2024-T3
sluminum alloy, which has an ultimate tensile
strength of Ftu = 65,000 psi; and the extruded
angles have a Ftu = 60,000. Thus M.S.
(60000/53000) - 1 = .13.


As a practice problem for the stUdent, the
ultimate bending resisting moment should be
calculated by the method of Article CIO.4 and
compared with the above margins of safety. The
result would show a greater margin of safety.



CIO.13


Check of Web Buckling Stress


The maximum shearing stress occurs at the
support pOint and equals 3750 Ibs. The web
thickness at this point i~57 and the web
stiffener spacing is 3.57 inches. The maximum
shearing stress on the web by the simplified
equation is,


f s = V/ht = 3750/7.125 x .057 = 9230 psi


By the more exact equation,

f s = I~ _I_ ydA = 9.87 [3] : [50] .057 (.264 x 3.446 +


.0375 x 3.673 + .057 x 3.6 x 1.8) = 9450 psi


Since the bending moment in the first web
panel adjacent to beam end support is practically
zero, the web can be considered as SUbjected to
shear stress only.


The buckling stress is given by equation
CIO.I.


b = 3.57 inches

a = distance between rivet lines = 7.125

alb = 7.125/3.57 = 2.0. Assuming simply
supported edge conditions, we obtain ks = 6.4
from Fig. C5.11 of Chapter C5.

F = n [2] x6.4xIO,700,000 (.057)2 = 15,800 psi
scr 12 (1 - .3 [2 ] ) 3.57


This stress is below the proportional limit
stress of the material so no plasticity
correction is necessary or _T/_ s = LO.


The margin of safety against buckling is
therefore (15,800/9450) - 1 = .67. This value
is somewhat conservative as boundary condition
for web panel is no doubt larger than for simply
supported, which condition was assumed.


Check of .057 Web at End of Bay 1.


The web will be more critical at this
point because the beam is still subjected to an
external shear load of 3750 Ibs., plus a bending
moment of 3750 x 23.22 = 87000 in. lb. at the
midpoint of the end panel.


Since the web is clamped between the flange
angles, buckling of the web will occur adjacent
to the lower end of the upper flange angles or
at a distance of 2.91 inches from neutral axis.


f b = My/I = 87000 x 2.91/9.87 = 25600


The bending buckling equation is,

The bending moment at the midpoint of the
web panel adjacent to the beam centerline is
123,200 in. lb. The shear load on the panel
is 1350 lb.

n = 11.5.

Rb = 34200/36300 = .94

M.S. = /.107" + .94" - 1 = .01


Check of Stiffness of the Web Stiffeners.


The web is stiffened by 1/2 x 1/2 x .04
angles on one side of the web. From Equation
(CIO.8), the moment of inertia required of web
stiffener to prevent web buckling is,


= 2.29x3.57 ( 3750 x 7.875 )4/3
.057 33 x 10,700,000


= .00050


The moment of inertia of stiffener crosssection is .00094, thus stiffness is satisfactory.


The required moment of inertia will also
be checked using curves in Fig. CIO.9. The
lower scale parameter in Fig. CIO.9 is d/h ~
where ks as used in buckling equation must be
multiplied by n" /1 - .3" = . 905. Thus,

d/h v'"k; = 3.57/7.125 _j_ 6.4x .905 = .208

Check of Rivets Attaching Web to Flange Angles.


End Bay. V = 3750 lb., t = .057


The horizontal shear load q per inch by

q = V/h' = 3750/8 = 468 lb. per inch


By the most exact CIO.12 equation,


V 3750
q _=11_ ydA = 9.87 (.264x3.446+ .0375x3.673)


q = 398


The single shear strength of 1/8 diameter
rivets made from 2117-T3 aluminum alloy is
388 Ibs. Since rivets are in double shear
and 1 inch spacing, rivet shear strength is
2 x 388 = 776 Ibs. versus the design load of
398 Ibs.



The value of the lower
Fig. C5.8 will be Fbcr/Fo.7

1.32. From Fig. C5.8 for n
Fbc/Fo.7 = .93. Therefore,

= 36300 psi.


The shear stress is,

of 398 lb. Thus rivets could be spaced further
apart as margin of safety is rather large.


The rivets attaching the skin to the upper
flange should be spaced to prevent inter-rivet
buckling of the skin, since the skin was
assumed effective in computing the beam moment
of inertia. The rivets attaching the lower
skin to the lower angles would be checked for
the shear flow load and not for inter-rivet
buckling since skin is in tension. The general
subject of rivet design for structures is
treated in Chapter Dl.


The web stiffeners at the external load
points and at the beam support points must be
designed to transfer the concentrated load to
the beam web. Refer to Chapter A21, which
treats of loads in such stiffeners.


General Co®nents


The reader should understand that the
margin of safety for the beam web in the preceding beam check was based on the design
requirement of no initial buckling under the
design load. The buckling stress as calculated
is not the stress that would cause web to fail
or COllapse, as the web could take considerably
more load in the buckled state. The subject of
beam design with buckling webs is treated in
Chapter Cll.


In general, this type of beam web design
is not widely used in flight vehicle structures
because it is heavy construction since the web
thickness must be relatively large to prevent
buckling and the cost of fabrication and
assembly is relatively high because of many
parts and much riveting. The aerospace
structures engineer decreases these disadvantages by using a web sheet with closely spaced



CI0.15


beads or a series of flanged lightening holes
which stabilize web against buckling and provide
low fabrication and assembly cost. This type of
web design is treated in Part 2 of this chapter.


CI0.15a Use of Longitudinal Stiffener to Increase Bending
Buckling Stress of Web Sheet.


The strength check of the beam in the
example problem showed that the compressive
stress on the web due to beam bending was the
factor that had great effect in producing the
web buckling. This web weakness can be improved
by adding a single longitudinal stiffener on the
compression side as illustrated in Fig. CIO.16.
Theoretical and experimental information on the
effect of such a stiffener is quite limited
(see Ref. 3). Such a stiffener can raise the
buckling coefficient kb to around 100 or more,
thus the web can be made somewhat thinner if
bending stresses are critical. Adding this
longitudinal stiffener means another structural
part and more assembly cost and therefore such
construction is not widely used although it
is a structural arrangement that will save
structural weight under certain conditions of
beam depth, span and external loading.

C10.16 DESIGN OF METAL EEAMS. WEB SHEAR RESISTANT (NON-BUCKLING) TYPE.


PART 2. OTHER TYPES OF NON-BUCKLING BEAM WEBS.


(BY W. F. McCOMBS)


C10. 16 Other Types of Web Design. Table C10. 5



At this point it should be noted that the
web design discussed in Part I required a large
number of parts (the stiffeners) to achieve
lightness. To keep manufacturing costs down,
the number of parts must be kept to a minimum.
A balance, or economic compromise must be
found between manufacturing expense and weight
penalty. This can be arrived at since in every
airplane design some l'dollar" penalty can be
assigned to every extra pound of weight. The
exact figure will depend upon the type of
airplane being designed. ThUS, eliminating
parts may incur some weight penalty but if the
savings in manufacturing cost is greater, then
the reduction in parts is economical.


Three types of shear resistant, nonbuckling webs are frequently used in aircraft
design to save the expense of stiffeners.
Actually, the web in most cases is as light,
or lighter, than a web with separate stiffeners.
There is a general limitation, however, in
that a stiffener must be provided wherever a
significant load is introduced into the beam.
The web types are:

The allowable shear flow, q in pounds per
inch at collapse, is given in Fig. CIO.IS, by
the solid lines. The dotted lines indicate
initial buckling setting in but this is not
failure (which is given by the solid lines).
This is the strongest of the web systems not

load if the shear stress at the yield load
h
over the net sections, C' x t and h-D x t, is

about equal to the yield stress of the web
material, Fs •
y

In general, it will be found, from formula
(18), that the larger holes (about D "'" - 8h) with
wider spacings, b, will give the lightest web
in designing for a given shear flow q, but the
stiffness will be less, of course.


Again, the allowables per formula (18) are
for pure shear only, no normal loads on the
web. Thus a stiffener must be provided wherever
a load is introduced into the beam and also in
areas where the beam may have significant
curvature as in round and elliptical bulkheads,
see Chapter D3.8. An example is given in
Art. CIO.19.


Z 900



In addition to the above (collapse), the
web should be checked for net shear stresses
through the holes to be sure that f SNET < F su
at ultimate load, q x h.


For a more complete discussion of this type
of web design and the test data, the reader
should review Refs. (2) and (1). Design charts
can be prepared from formula (18), Fig. CIO.18,
and Table CIO.6 for use in designing without
having to resort to formula (18). Figure CIO.21
shows such a chart taken from Ref. (2) for the
cases of D/h = .80 and D/h = .50.


C10. 19 Webs With Round Beaded Flange Lightening Holes
and Intermediate Vertical Male Beads.


A third type of web has round holes with
beaded flanges and vertical "male" beads
between the holes. Such a beam is shown in
Fig. CIO.22. The vertical bead is as described
in Table CIO.5. The beaded flange shown is
described in Table CIO.7. For the particular
case where O~. = .6 and the hole spacing is

equal to h, the allowable shear flows shown in
Fig. CIO.23 apply.

The solid lines of Fig. CIO.23 give the
ultimate strength, q, of the web as a function
of web height, h. This represents the total
collapsing strength of the web. The dotted
lines indicate the shear flow, q, at which
initial buckling begins. If the O.D. is greater
than .6 x h, or if the spacing of holes is

reduced, the allowables will be reduced but no
data is included for other geometries. As in
other cases, Arts. CIO.16 and CIO.17, the data
is for pure shear only, no normal loads. Hence
loading stiffeners must be used (replacing the
vertical bead locally) and Article D3.8 should
be reviewed.


Of course, in all three types of formed
webs, a small amount of normal loading can be
tolerated, but no limit is defined. Typical
cases are wing ribs and fuselage frames where
only relatively light normal air loads are
distributed by the rib without loading stiffeners.
In such cases some extra margin of safety above
the shear load is usually used, depending upon
the designers jUdgment and/or sUbstantiating
element tests. Where large distributed loads
are involved, as in a beam supporting a fuel
cell, or where the beam curvature is significant
(See D3.7), stiffeners should be used for the
lightest design.


As a final note, whenever using webs with
formed beads as in CIO.17 and CIO.19, it is
important that the beads be formed with a length
long enough to extend as close to the beam
flanges as assembly will allow. Short beads,
ending well away from the flanges, will not
develop the strength indicated by the allowables
given in the figures. Rivets attaching the web
to the flange above a hole also need be more
closely spaced to take the higher "net" shear
locally.


CI0.20 Example Problems.


For the beam shown in Fig. CIO.24, determine
the web gages required for


a) a beaded web, as in CIO.17.


b) a 45 [0] flanged hole web as in CIO.18.


c) a beaded flange hole web with intermediate beads as in ClO.l9.


The beam shown in Fig. CIO.2~ has the same
external dimensions and design load system as the
beam shown in Fig. CIO.14 and used for the
example problem in Part 1 of this chapter. In
these example problems, we are replacing the
web design by the three variations (a), (b) and
(c). Since the webs cannot be considered fully

effective in resisting beam bending stresses,
the flanges would be stresseq slightly higher
than found in the example problem of Part 1.
Using the same beam dimensions and beam design

weights for the various web designs.


Using the simplified formula, the shear

hole we get



a) Beaded Web Gage Requirements.


Entering Fig. CIO.18 with q = 526 Ib./in.
and h = 7.125" we find that the minimum
acceptable gage is .051". Thus the web
of Bay A should be .051", giving
q 11a ow. = 770 Ib./in., from Fig. CIO.18.
770
M.S. = 526 - 1 = .46

Repeating for the web of Bay B, enter with
q = 189 Ib./in. and h = 7.125" and find
the minimum acceptable gage is .032, which
has qALL = 310 Ib./in. Thus for Bay B,


M. S. = -- 310    - 1 = .64
189 =


b) A 45 [0] Flange Round Lightening Hole.


Since the larger diameter (and more widely
spaced) holes are more efficient weightwise, try a hole having D = .8h or D =
5.61" from Table CIO.6. Spacing two holes
in the 25" bays would indicate a spacing
b = 12.5". Then, from CIO.19


C :: b - D = 12.5       - 5 .6 = 6. 9

B = .19, from Table CIO.6


C'= C -2B = 6.9-2 (.19) = 6.52


Now determine the allowable value of q
for, say, t = .081" for Bay A.


.Q. :: 7 .125 = 88
t .081


k = .85 - .0006 (88) :: .80


From Fig. CIO.20, for ~ = 88 and ~ = 85


f Sn = 13,200

Repeating with the above geometry and using
t = .051 for Bay "B" where q = 189 Ib./in.,
we get


qALL. =   - 77( .051) [ 7900( .38) + 8300 ( .887)] (.521)

= .0393 [10,630](.521) = 217 Ib./in.


M S 217 1 = .15

The reader can repeat the above for smaller
sizes of holes and thickness to see if a
lighter arrangement (NET web weight) can
be obtained. It can be seen that the
example gages are confirmed by the data of
Fig. CIO.21 extrapolating in the case of
the .081 web.


c) A Beaded Flange Hole with Intermediate
Vertical Beads.


The geometry for this is as previously
discussed (O.D. - .6h and b = h).


First determine gage for Bay A. Entering
Fig. CIO.23 with h = 7.125" and q =
526 Ib./in., the closest acceptable gage
is t = .064 (solid line), giving

Actually, a hole with O.D. = 4.43 (from
Table CIO.7) could be used even though

O.D. - 4.43 = .62 is a little larger
-h- - 7.125

than .6, since the M.S. above is well
above zero.


A comparison of the total weights of each
of the 3 types of webs is given in Table
CIO.B, using a hole diameter of 5.61" for
webs (b) and 3.31" (from Table CIO.7) for
webs (c) and a density of .10 Ib./in.
for aluminum. Fig. CIO.25

Thus for a "non-distributed" load, web
(a), a beaded web, is lightest for Bays
"A" and (c) is lightest for Bays "B". If
"access" for lines is required then a web
of type (c) or (b) should be used for
Bays "A".


The weight of the web and vertical
stiffeners designed for no initial buckling
under combined bending and shear gave a
value of 5.82 Ibs., or much neavier than
the other designs.

Cll. 1 Introduction.


The aerospace structures engineer is
constantly searching for types of structures
and methods of structural analysis and design
which will save structural weight and still
provide a structure which is satisfactory from
a fabrication and economic standpoint. The
development of a structure in which buckling
of the webs is permitted with the shear loads
being carried by diagonal tension stresses in
the web is a striking example of the departure
of the design of aerospace structures from the
standard structural design methods in other
fields of structures, such as beam design for
bridges and buildings. The first study and
research on this new type of structural design
involving diagonal semi-tension field action
in beam webs was by Wagner (Ref. 1), and because of this fact, this type of beam design
is often referred to as a Wagner beam.


In Chapter CIO, Part 1, the SUbject of
beam design with shear resistant (non-buckling)
flat webs was covered. This type of web design
leads to a comparatively heavy weight, which
fact prevents its wide use in aerospace
structures. Part 2 of Chapter CIO dealt with
webs stiffened by closely spaced beads, flanged
lightening holes, etc., a design which shows an
improvement relative to web weight over the
flat sheet web with vertical stiffeners.
However, a large proportion of sheet panels
used in aerospace stru~tures is part of the
external surface and holes and deep beads in
the surface skin cannot be permitted, thus
continuous sheet is required and to save
structural weight, semi-tension field action
in the webs and surface sheet panels must be
permitted, which means a wrinkling type of
structure.


Since the original work by Wagner, much
further study and testing of structures
involving semi-tension field design has been
carried out by both industry and government
agencies, hence a fairly accurate procedure
for the design of such structures has been
developed and this chapter is concerned with a
limited presentation of the principles involved
and the design procedures that have been
developed.



Fig. Cll.l shows a single bay truss with
double diagonal members (A) and (B) and
carrying an external load P. The load P will
cause a compressive load in member (A) and a
tensile load in member (B). If member (A) is
quite flexible it will buckle as a long column
as shown in Fig. Cll.lb, when load P is
relatively small, however, panel will not
collapse. As the load P is increased, the
member (A) cannot take any more load but it will
practically hold its column buckling load as the
bending deflection or bOWing gets larger.
However, member (B) being in tension can take
further load until it reaches its ultimate
tensile strength. Thus any increase of the
shear in the panel due to an increase of load
P after diagonal (A) has buckled can be carried
by a further increase of tension load in member
(B) •

Fig. Cll.2 shows the same panel but with
the two diagonals replaced by a flat sheet web.
Under a small load (p), the web will not buckle
and the stress picture on a small web element
is shown in Fig. Cll.2a, and fc = ft = f s where
f s is the shear stress in the web at this
particular point on the web. Now thin flat
sheet is relatively weak under compression, thus
when panel load P is increased, the compressive
stress fc reaches the buckling stress of the
panel in the diagonal direction and the web
buckles, however, the panel does not collapse
as further increase in load P can be handled by

Cll.2 DIAGONAL SEMI-TENSION FIELD DESIGN



further increase in ft or diagonal tension in
the web sheet. The web has an ability to hold
the f c stress that caused buckling but cannot
increase it. Fig. Cll.2b shows the web stress
picture after the load P has been increased
considerably, thus increasing the di8.gonal web
tensile stress as shown by the length of the
vector for ft. Since the shear load on the
panel is transferred by diagonal tension in the
web and since flat sheet is efficient in
tension, this method of carrying the shear load
permits the use of relatively thin webs because
of the high allowable design stresses in
tension. Fig. Cll.3 shows a photograph of a
thin web beam under load. Since the diagonal
wrinkling appears severe, the external load
being carried is no doubt approaching the
failing point of the web. The student should
realize that such a degree of web wrinkling
does not occur under normal flying accelerations
since the loads carried in normal flying
conditions are only a fraction of the design
loads, and thus the buckling and wrinkling is
barely noticeable under accelerations of 1/2
gravity, which may be encountered often in
flying in gusty weather conditions.


Cll.3 Elementary Derivation of Approximate TensionField Beam Formulas.



Fig. Cll.4 shows a cantilever beam with
parallel chords and vertical stiffeners subjected to a single shear load V at the free end.
The dashed diagonal lines indicate the direction
of the wrinkles as the thin sheet buckles under
the load V.


Assuming that the flange angles develop all
the bending resistance, the vertical and horizontal shearing stress is constant over the web

From elementary mechanIcs the horIzontal
and vertIcal shearIng stresses produce compressIve and tensIle stresses on planes at 45 [0]
wIth the shearIng planes.


The web, beIng very thIn, can carry very
lIttle compressIon stress on the surface (AC)
of FIg. Cll.5 before bucklIng; thus thIs small
stress whIch produces bucklIng on AC wIll be
neglected or f c = O. The edge BC Is subjected
to tensIle stresses whIch the sheet can carry
effectIvely. The forces actIng on the sheet
element are Shown In FIg. Cll.5.

RIvet Loads


The sheet element Is held to the flange
angles by the rIvets along lIne (AB). The
rIvets are subjected to two loads, one parallel
to AB and one normal to AB; and each force
equals f s tdx. The resultant rIvet load therefore equals Vlf f s tdx; and If dx Is taken as
one Inch, the resultant load wIll be V1f fs t.


But f s = V/ht, hence


RIvet load/Inch = 1.41 V/h   - - - - - (6)


Web StIffener Load


The tendency of the web In FIg. Cll.4 whIch
has broken down Into the tensIon bands, Is to
pull the flanges together; thIs actIon Is
prevented by the vertIcal stIffeners whIch keep
the flanges apart. Thus If a pure tensIon fIeld
Is assumed, the axIal compressIve load Ps In the
stIffeners from FIg. Cll.6 equals the vertIcal
component of the

Cll.4 General Wagner Equations for Tension Field Beams.


The approximate elementary derivation giVen
in the previous article was for the purpose of
giving the student a general idea of the
influence of a complete tension field beam on
the various beam stresses. The angle _a_ is in
general not 45 [0] but depends on flange areas,
beam height, stiffener spacing, etc.


The general equations derived by Wagner
(Ref. 1) are as follows:


For beams with infinitely rigid and
parallel flanges with vertical web stiffeners:


Diagonal tensile stress in web:


2V 1
ft = ht    - sin 2 _a_    - - - - - - -(10)


Axial load in tension flange:



F Stiff . =- V ~ tan _a_   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   - (13)


In the above equations:


V = applied shear load
h = distance between centroids of flangeweb rivets
h' = distance between centroids of flange
sections
t = web thickness
d = vertical web stiffener spacing
_a_ = angle of web buckle (see Fig. Cll.7)


In deriving equations (10) to (13) Wagner
assumed that the beam flanges were infinitely
stiff in bending. Actually the flanges due to
the lateral pull of the web tension field will
act somewhat as a continuous beam over the web
stiffeners as supports, as illustrated in Fig.
Cll.sa. The deflections of the beam flanges
relieves the web stress in the midportion of
the panels and concentrates the web stress near
the stiffeners where deflection of the flange
is prevented (see Fig. Cll.Bb).

Wagner (Ref. 2, Part III) has developed a
correction factor R to take care of this web
stress concentration due to flange deflection.
This stress ratio factor is obtained from Fig.
Cll.9 and the following equations:

d = stiffener spacing


Iu and IL = moment of inertia of upper and

**Cll.5**


(3) The remainder of the beam shear after
subtracting that carried by (1) and (2) is conSidered carried by the web in a buckled state
in the fonn of a diagonal tension field 

The above assumptions apply to beams with
parallel fl~nge members. If the beam h~s sloping
flanges, part of the beam shear will be carried
by the shear component of the flange axial loads,
and thus the assumptions should be applied to
tile net beam shear.


**Cll.6** Shear Carried by the Beam Flanges .


The general flexural shear flow equation is

q = V ~YdA = _Vi_ (if !ydA is given symbol Q)


For beam flange and web arrangements
commonly used in aircraft structures the shear
stresses are approximately constant over the
web, that is, between the centroids of the
flange-web rivets. Using this assumption, the
value Q in the above e:luation equals the static
moment of the flange area about the neutral axis
of the beam, and I equals the moment of inertia
of the flange area about neutral axis. (web
area is neglected).



As = area of stiffener The shear load resisted by the web alone
therefore equals

**Cll.** 5 Modified Wagner Equations for Use in Design.


The Wagner equations are too conservative
for design, particularly in the web stresses
and the loads in the vertical stiffeners. The
shear stress carried by the web before it
buckles is in many cases an appreciable part
of the total resistance, as the buckled sheet
nonnal to the di~gon~l compressive stresses has
the ability to hold this buckling shear load
after wrinkling. The load in the vertical
stiffener is too conservative, since the
stiffener is riveted to the web and the web is
riveted to the flange; thus the web acts as a
large gusset plate instead of a pin end
condition as assurr.ed in the Wagner equation.


The following general method nf analysis
of Wagner bea~s has been used by many airplane
companies. Instead of assuming that the entire
beam shear is taken by the web in diagonal
tension, the following assumptions are made
relative to the resistance for carrying the

bea~ vertical shear.


(1) The shear strength of the beam flanges
is not neglected.


(2) The shear carried by the web before it
buck}es, that is, as a shear resistant member is
considered as an effective resistance and not
neglected.



VQh V
V w = -1-= I/Q,h   - - - - - - - - - - - (17)


where


h = effective web depth = distance between
centroids of flange-web connection rivets.


The total beam shear V which equals the
resistance of both web and flange, equals



V w I
V = Qh



(18)



The difference between (17) and (18) gives
the shear carried by flanges.


**Cll.7** Shear Load Carried by Web.


Up to the buckling stress of the web plate,
the shear flow is assurned to be of constant intensity over the effective web depth. When the
web buckles, it is assQmed that the web maintains the diagonal critical compressive stress
that produced the buckling of the plate. For
further increase of shear load on the web, the
entire resistance is provided by the increase in
diagonal tensile stresses with no increase in
the diagonal compressive stresses. In other
words, for loads above the web buckling point,
the web acts as a pure tension field beam. Fig.
Cll.lO illustrates these assUffi)tions.

on the web face (aa) when the web is shear

and tensile stresses. The intensity of these

Hence the shear load carried by the web

a rivet correction factor _l/K_ _r_ to obtain the

Equation (22) would apply for webs spot
welded to flange members.


The vertical components of the total ft
stresses on the web effective depth (h) would
thus equal the shear load Yt developed by the
web after buckling.


For spot welded flange, web and stiffeners

Yt = (ftmax. - F scr ) Rht sin _a_ cos _a_   - (25)


For riveted connections:

point stress Fty or the ultimate tensile stress

Ytu = (Ftu -~) K r R ht sin _a_ cos _a_

Ytu = (Ftu   - F scr ) Rht sin a cos _a_   - - (30)
(spot welded connect.)


The total yield shear resistance of the
web equals



Vcr = F s cr h t



(19)



The critical shear buckling stress is
given by the following equation from C5.4 of
Chapter C5.


11" ks E t"
F Scr = 12 (1 _ Va) (1»)   -   -   -   -   - -   - (20)


where ks is a function of the aspect ratio alb
of the shear panel and of the edge conditions.
Fig. C5.11 of Chapter C5 gives the value of ks
for edges simply restrained. Taking a value
of ks for this edge condition is no doubt
slightly conservatiVe.


Shear Load Carried by Web after Buckling


Fig. Cll.10b shows the web stress distribution that is assumed to be subjected to the
web when the web shear load is increased above
that which caused the web to break down into a
tension field. The diagonal tensile stress ft
tends to pUll the beam flanges together, and
thus to bend the flanges. The diagonal tensile
stress ft for the shear resistant web does not
produce such action. To obtain the maximum
combined tensile stress in the web, the stress
f t must be multiplied by a concentration factor
l/R from Fig. Cll.9.


Hence

Cll.8 Beams with Parallel Flanges but with Oblique
Web Stiffeners.


Wagner has developed equations for the
condition where stiffeners are placed at an
angle with the parallel flange members, (Fig.A).
In this case equations (27) to (30) should be
mUltiplied by a correction factor equal to
(1 - tan a cot _jJ)_ where _fJ_ is the upright angle.
For oblique stiffeners the wrinkle field angle
a is equal toj7/2 and the concentration factor
R can be taken as unity. Hence the equations
for Vty and Vtu become as follows:

Cll.9 Rivet Loads.


The loads on the rivets connecting the
flanges to the web consists of two parts, (1)
that due to the web acting as a shear resistant
member subjected to stresses which cause web
buckling, and (2) that due to the web tension
field for web stresses above the web buckling
stress.

**Cll.10** **Flange Loads.**


The axial flange loads are due to two
primary causes, namely


(1) stresses due to primary bending of
the beam by the usual flexural theory.


(2) Additional stresses produced by the
web tension field.


In addition to these two primary effects,
secondary bending stresses due to the bending
of the flange because of the tension field are
produced as illustrated in Fig. Cll.B.


Stresses for Primary Bending:

fb = +    - -1-- :M cr Y + (:M    - :Mcr)Y IF (44)


where


I = moment of inertia of total section

including web about neutral axis


IF = moment of inertia of section without
web about neutral axis


:M cr = bending moment for load which causes
web buckling


:M = total bending moment on section


The first term in the above equation gives
the bending stresses at the point where the web
breaks down into a tension field. The web is
thus effective in computing the moment of
inertia **I.** The second term in the equation
gives the bending stresses when the beam web
acts as a tension field web, or in other words
the buckled web is assumed ineffective in
bending.


To be slightly conservative the bending
stresses can be computed by the following



where


Fc and Ft = total compressive and tensile
flange load respectively


**h'** **=** distance between flange
centroids


Equation (46) neglects the resistance of
the web in bending.


Flange Axial Stresses Due to Web Tension Field


Due to the horizontal components of the
diagonal tension field each flange is subjected
to a compressive load equal to


Vt
Fc = Ft = _-Tcot_ a   - - - - - - - - (47)


(Reference see Equation (12) and general
derivation when a = 45 [0] see Equation (8) and (9).


In Equation (47) Vt = shear load carried by
tension field action.


Secondary Bending Stresses


For estimating the secondary bending moments
on flanges due to lateral pUll of web tension
field, the flange can be treated as a continuous
beam with spans equal to the stiffener spacing.


The component of the web diagonal tensile
stresses normal to flange.


Vt
W v = 11 tan _a_ (pounds per inch)   - - - (48)


where


Vt = shear carried by web in diagonal
tension


For a continuous beam of equal spans, the
2
moment over the supports = 1/12 W v d, where d
equals the stiffener spacing. The deflection of
the flanges tends to relieve the pull in the
center portion between stiffeners which then
decreases the continuity moment over the support.
Wagner (Ref. 1) gives a relieVing factor C (See


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-785-full.png)

Fig. Cll.9) for use with the bending moment
expression.


Therefore, the secondary bending moment on

Cll.ll Loads in Web Vertical Stiffeners.


The following method of checking the
strength of vertical web stiffeners was
orIginally proposed by Wagner (Refs. 1, 2) and
can be considered conservative.


The axial column load in the web stiffener
equals


d
F stHf. Vt "htan _a_   - - (50)


This is the same as equation (13) except
V is replaced by Vt, the shear carried by the
web in diagonal tension field action. Under
this load Wagner considers the stiffeners as
columns with elastic supports as the web
tensIon restrains the struts from buckling out
of the plane of the web. Wagner's calculations
yield a reduction factor C e which the actual
length of the stiffener is multiplied by to
obtain a reduced length L', or


L' = CaL    - - - - - - - - - - - - - -(50a)


With this reduced length L', and the actual
cross section of the strut, the column strength
can be calculated by the methods of Chapters C2
and C7. Fig. Cll.12 by Wagner shows a plot of
the reduction factor C which is a function of
the parameter as shown.


Since the work of Wagner, the NACA has
conducted an extensive research program on the
strength and design of semi-tension field beams
and the strength design of the web stiffeners
has been based on a more rational basis. The
NACA method Is given later in this chapter and
It is recommended that for fInal check of web

method above, proposed originally by Wagner,
can be used for quIck preliminary desIgn of the

parallel but have a slIght taper. For this case
equatIons (46) and (47) give only the horizontal
components of the flange loadS. The total flange

The buckling coefficient ks for an alb
ratio of 2.856 and simply supported edges is
obtained from Fig. C5.11 of Chapter C5 which
gives ks = 5.8. Substituting in (A),

F = n [2] x5.8xIO,500,000 (.025)2 =342 ps
scr 12 (1 - .3 [2] ) 10


Therefore shear load resistance developed
by web up to buckling stress equals


Vcr = F Scr h t = 342x28.56x .025 = 244 lb.

tension field after buckling is given by the

The applied shear load using a factor of
safety of 1.5 is 13,500/1.5 = 9000 lb.



The yield strength is 10,670 lb. Thus for
margin of safety of yield strength over applied
load, we have (10,670/9000) - 1 = .18.



load, we have (10,670/9000) - 1 = .18. Bearing strength on 2024-T3 sheet = 1.24 x

The results show that the beam shear
resistance is proportioned as follows for a Bearing is critical and the rivet strength
total ultimate strength of 16,070 lb., per rivet pitch is 2 x 486 = 972 lb. (2 rows of

rivets).

(244/16,070 x 100 = 1.5% carried by web in pure
shear, and 15,iOO/16,070) 100 = 96.0% carried
by web as a diagonal tension field. Margin of Safety = (972/468) - 1 = 1.08



Bearing is critical and the rivet strength
per rivet pitch is 2 x 486 = 972 lb. (2 rows of
rivets).



Margin of Safety = (972/468) - 1 = 1.08



The remainder or 2.5% is carried by the
shear strength of the flanges. This value is
relatively low for this particular beam, as in
general the flange may provide considerably
more of the resistance. Due to the thin web
thickness and the large web panels, the web
buckles at a relatively low stress, thus the
percent of the external shear load carried by
the web at the buckling stress is quite small.


Check of Rivet Attachment - Web to Flange


The .025 web is attached to the flange
member by 2 rows of 5/32 diameter 2117-T3 rivets
at 3/4 inch spacing.


The resultant load on the rivets per inch
of flange is given by equation (43), namely

P [r] = [( [Vcr IF +] h I [ VtU)2] h [ + (Vtu] h [ tan] [ a)] [ J] J [~/2] **--** (B)


The web is not stressed to its ultimate
tensile stress since we have 4% margin of
safety. We will therefore solve equation (A)
for Vtu using the given external shear load
V = 13,.500 lb., and call this value Vt, the



Due to large M.S., the rivet diameter
could be made 1/8 inch, or 5/32 rivets could
be spaced farther apart.


CHECK OF FLANGE STRENGTH


The end bay of the cantilever beam involves
special design considerations such as the two
beam fittings and the special end stiffener.
Therefore, the basic flange areas will be checked
at Section A-A, which is 50 inches from the load
point, which is where the end fitting would
possibly begin to take load out of the flange
members.


Design bending moment at beam Section A-A
is,


50 x 13,500 = 675,000 in. lb.


Since Vcr = 244 lb., which is the shear
load the web carries without buckling, the
bending moment due to a shear of 244 lb. will
be resisted by the entire cross-section including
the web. Above this value the remaining moment
is resisted by the section wi th the web neglected
in computing the moment of inertia.


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-788-full.png)

**Cll.12** **DIAGONAL** **SEMI-TENSION** **FIELD** **DESIGN**



Thus bending moment at web buckling load =
244 x 50 = 12200 in. lb.


Bending moment for tension field beam =
675,000 - 12200 = _66280b_ in. lb.


Bending stresses


Upper Flange Bending stresses:

f b = - 270.5 210


(See Eq. 44)


    - - 567 - 34600 =- 35167 psi.


If the entire bending moment were assumed
resisted by the flanges alone, then,


fb = 67500~1~ 10.94 = _ 35200 psi.


Lower Flange Bending Stresses


fb =- 1220~7~.~ 17.42 + - 66280~1~ 19.06


= 783 + 60200 = 60980 psi.


(Note: Section properties were computed without taking out one 5/32 rivet hole in
vertical leg of flange tee, thus
stresses are slightly unconservative.
To be on the safe side, the net section
properties should be used in figuring
stresses).

Upper Flange fC(aver.) = -22900/.675 =

Lower Flange ft( aver. ) = 22900/.378 =

60500 psi.


Flange Axial Loads Due to Tension Field Action


The axial load in each flange due to
diagonal tension in web equals


Ft = Fc = -.5 Vt cot a (See Eq. 47)


= -.5 x 12850 x 1.07 = -6860


Average stress on upper flange


f c =- 6860/.675 = -10,170 psi.


Lower flange, ft = -6860/.378 = -18180 psi.


Combined Flange Axial Stresses

f c = -35167 - 10770 = -4.5337 ps i .



Average stress:

Lower Flange     - Extreme Fiber


ft = 60980 18180 = 42800 psi.


Average ft = 60500 18180 = 42320 psi.


Since the tension field action tends to
decrease the tension load in the lower flange,
it is good practice not to include the entire
relieving effect as tension field action is not
an exact theory.


Flange Secondary Bending Stresses


Since the web is in a diagonal tension
condition, it pulls on the flange members, or
in other words, each flange acts as a continuous beam with the web stiffeners as the support
points and the transverse load on the flange is
equal to the vertical component of the web
diagonal tensile stresses. This secondary bending moment is approximated by equation (49).

The combined stresses on lower flange are:

f (lower fiber) = 42800 + 24100 = 66900 psi


Calculation of Failing Compressive Stress for
Upper Flange.


It will be assumed that lateral column
action is prevented by lateral bracing from
adjacent structure, thus failure of flange will
be by local crippling.


The crippling stress for the flange as a
whole will be calculated by the Gerard method
as given in Chapter C7. The bulbs on the Tee
Section (see Fig. Cll.13) will be assumed as
only partially effective in producing a simple
support to the adjacent plate. The g number
for the Tee Section will be taken as 4 which is
no doubt slightly conservative. The design
curve of Fig. C7.7 of Chapter C7 will be used.


gt A 2 (~)~/2 Ec = 4x 0.675 .1562 [2] ( 10,300,000 70,000 ) ~/2 = .572


From Fig. C7.7 we read Fcs/F cy = .90,
hence F cs = .9 x 70000 = 63000 psi. compression.


Without the effect of secondary bending of
flanges, the average axial stress on upper
flange was previously calculated to be -44070
psi. Thus margin of safety would be
(63000/44070) - 1 ::: .43. However, the upper
flange must also carry the stresses due to the
flange acting as a continuous beam with the web
vertical stiffeners as the support points. This
bending moment over the support points was
previously calculated to be 3230 inch lbs. The
bending moment midway between the support
points would be about 50 percent of this value
since lateral deflection of flange produces a
relieving effect. The previous calculations
gave the combined stress on upper fiber as
-35197 psi, and on the lower fiber as -78970
psi. This compressive stress is above the Fey
value of 70000 for 7075-T6 material and thus
the vertical leg of the Tee is obviously weak.
The permissible average stress on the vertical
leg can be calculated by considering it part of
an equal angle section and computing the
crippling stress by the Needham method of
Chapter C7. The result would be -51500 psi,
thus with a stress of -78970 existing weakness
is indicated and re-design is necessary.


The question now arises, what changes can
be made without adding any weight to the
present flange. Two obvious faults exist in
the flange design. (1) For a beam 30 inches
deep, increasing the depth of the flange by a
small amount such as 0.6 inch would not effect
appreciably the over-all beam bending strength,



ell. 13


however, the 0.5 inch increase in depth of the
Tee would raise the moment of inertia of the
Tee considerably. (2) The strength of the
vertical leg of the Tee can be improved by
adding a lip. This addition will likewise
increase the flange moment of inertia, which is
needed to decrease the stresses due to the
secondary bending action.


Fig. _(A)_ shows a re-design of the flange
section with the same area as before, thus no
weight is added. The Tee has been made 0.5
inch more in height and an 0.5 inch wide lip
has been added to bottom of Tee. The thickness

and bulb size has been reduced to cancel the
area added. The new section properties are
given in Fig. A.

_I/Y_ lower fiber = • 25


The secondary bending stresses will now be
recalculated.


3230
::: = - 12900
fb(upper) .25


f = 3230 = 5530
b(lower) .584


The combined stress on the lower fiber is
-44070 - 12900 = -56970 psi as against the
previous value of -78970 before Tee was modified.
Adding the lip on the bottom of the Tee would
raise the allowable stress above the -51500
previously calculated, thus stress of -56970
can now be carried.


This example problem has brought out the
fact that the secondary bending stresses can be
a major stress factor unless proper attention
is given to designing the flange to reduce the
secondary bending stresses.


Another approach to calculating or checking
the strength of the flange would be to use the
inter-action equation,


R c + Rb ::: 1


where Rc is equal to the flange load due to beam

**Cll.14** **DIAGONAL** **SEMI-TENSION** **FIELD** **DESIGN**



bending and web diagonal tension effect, divided
by the crippling stress F cs of the flange
section.


Rb is the ultimate bending moment that the
flange can develop as per the method presented
in Chapter C3, divided by the design secondary
bending moment.


Strength Check Lower Flange (Tension Flange)


As previously calculated, the stress on
bottom fiber was 66900 psi tension and -61880
psi compression on the upper fiber of the
lower flange. The tension is O.K. since the
Ftu of the material is 78000 psi which should
give enough margin of safety to take care of
rivet holes. However, the compressive stress
of -61880 is too high and re-design is
necessary. The difficulty is due to the large
stress from secondary bending. Thus making
similar changes for the lower flange Tee as was
done for upper flange Tee would solve the
problem without adding appreciable weight.

Fig. **Cll.14**     - State of Stress in a Beam Web.


In the usual practical thin web beam in
aircraft construction, the state of stress in
the web is intermediate between pure shear and
pure diagonal tension. The engineering theory
as developed by the NACA considers that this
intermediate state of incomplete diagonal
tension may be based on the assumption that the
total shear force in the web can be divided into
two parts, a part Ss carried by pure shear and
a part 8DT carried by pure diagonal tension.


Thus under this assumption one can write,


S = Ss + 8DT, which can be written in the
form



where k is the "diagonal-tension factor" which
expresses the degree to which the diagonal
tension is developed by a given load. Thus the
state of pure shear is measured by k = 0 and the
state of pure diagonal tension by k = 1. Fig.
Cll.15 illustrates the stress condition for the
limiting cases of k = 0 and k = 1 and for the
intermediate case. The letters PS, DT and PDT
as labeled on Fig. Cll.15 mean pure shear,
diagonal tension and pure diagonal tension
respectively relative to web stress conditions.

Cll.15 Engineering Theory of Incomplete Diagonal
Tension.


In a beam with a thin flat sheet as a web,
if the external shear load is less than the
buckling load for the web, then the web is in a
state of pure shear at the neutral axis as
indicated in Fig. Cll.14 (Fig. a). If we
neglect the normal stresses due to bending over
the depth of the web, this shear stress
arrangement can be assumed constant over the
full depth of the web.


If a web is thin, it will buckle under a
certain critical load and if the load is in

(1) Uprights on web stiffeners should not

(2) The upright or web stiffener spacing

(3) The tests by NACA did not cover beams
with very thin or very thick webs, hence some
possibility of inconservative predictions may
h
exist if t:> 1500 or less than 200.


Cll.17 Critical Shear Stress.


In the elastic range, the critical shear
stress between two web uprights is calculated
by the formula:

where,


k ss = theoretical buckling coefficient
(given in Fig. Cll.16a for panel
length of hc and width dc with
simply supported edges.


dc = width of sheet between uprights
measured as shown in Fig. Cll.16a.


hc = depth of web measured as shown in
Fig. Cl1.16a.


Rh = restraint coefficient for edges of
sheet along upright (See Fig.
Cl1.16b).


Rd = restraint coefficient for edges of
sheet along flanges. (See Fig.
Cl1.16b)      

(If dc :> hc, SUbstitute hc for dc ; dc for
hc ; Rd for Rh; and Rh for Rd)'


Curves of the critical shear stresses for
plates of 2024 aluminum alloy with simply sup


ported edges are given in Fig. Cll.l? To the
right of the dashed line the curves in Fig.
Cll.l? are plots of the theoretical equation,


(54)


and may be used for most aluminum alloys. To
the left of the dashed line, the curves represent straight line tangents to the theoretical
curves in a nonlogarithmic plot and are valid
only for 2024 aluminum alloy.


If the critical shear buckling stress is
above the proportional limit stress for the
material, a plasticity correction must be made.
Fig. Cll.18 presents curves for correcting the
calculated elastic values for this plasticity
effect. The plasticity correction for other
materials can be obtained as explained in Art.
C5.8 and Fig. C5.13 of Chapter C5.


Cll.18 Loading Ratio.


The loading ratio is the ratio fs/F scr
where f s is the depth-wise average or nominal
shear stress.


When the depth of the flanges is small
compared with the depth of the beam and the
flanges are angle sections, the stress f s may
be computed by the formula


_ Sw

                                f [s ]       - he t (55)


In beams with other cross-sections, the
average nominal shear stress should be computed
by the formula


Sw QF 2 Qw
f s = It (1 + 3 QF)       - - - - - - - - (56)


Where QF is the static moment about the neutral
axis of the flange material and Qw is the static
moment about the neutral axis of the effective
web material above the neutral axis. For the
computation of I and Q, the effectiveness of the
web must be estimated in the first approximation.
As second and final approximation, the effectiveness of the web may be taken as equal to
(1 - k), where k is the diagonal-tension factor
determined in the next step. Thus in computing
I and Q the effective web thickness is (1 - k) t.


Cll. 19 Diagonal-Tension Factor k.


Having determined the loading ratio fs/F scr '
the diagonal tension factor k can be read from
Fig. Cl1.19.

side of web) can be calculated by the formula, Four types of failure are conceivable.



k f s tan _a_
f u = ---=:...-_---       - - - - - - (57)

<it Au + .05 (1      - k )


This equation can be evaluated With the
use of Fig. Cll.20. The stress fu is uniformly
distributed over the cross-section of the
upright until buckling of the upright begins.


Eq. 57 assumes the values f s, k, and a to
be the same in the panels on each side of the
stiffener. If they are not, then average
values should be used, or a conservative check
should be made using the largest shear value.


Single Upright (or Web Stiffener on one side of
Web)


The stress fu for a single upright is
obtained in the same manner, except that the
ratio Au/dt is replaced by Au Idt, where
e

Au
Au =   - - - - - - - - - - - (58)
e 1 + (~)2

P


For the single upright fu is still an average
over the length of the upright, but it applies
only to the median plane of the web along the
line of rivets connecting the upright to the
web. In any given cross-section of the upright,
the compressive stress decreases with increasing
distance from the web, because the upright is a
column loaded eccentrically by the web tension.
Thus formulas for local crippling based on
uniform distribution of stress over the crosssections do not apply.


Maximum Stress in Upright


The stress fu in the upright varies from a
maximum at (or near) the neutral axis of the
beam to a minimum at the ends of the upright
("gusset effect"). The maximum value is given
by the following equation:


(1) Column Failure.
(2) Forced Crippling Failure.
(3) Natural Crippling Failure.
(4) General elastic instability failure
of web and stiffeners.


Column Failure


Column failures in the usual meaning of the
word (faIlure due to instability, without
previous bowing) are possible only in double
uprights. When column bowing begins, the uprights will force the web out of its original
plane. The web tensile forces will then develop
components normal to the plane of the web which
tend to force the uprights back. This bracing
action is taken into account by using a reduced
"effective" column length Le of the upright,
which is given by the following empirical
formula,


/1 + k 2 (3    - 2 ~)    -    -    -    -    -    -    - (60)


The stress f u at which column failure takes
place can be found using the standard column
curve With the slenderness ratio Le/p as shown.


The problem of "column" failures in a single
upright has not been investigated to any extent
and test results are greatly at variance with
theoretical results. Two criterions are
suggested for strength design, namely:

(a) The stresses fu should be no greater
than the column yield stress for the upright
material. This accounts for the upright acting
as an eccentrically loaded compression member.


(b) The stress at the centroid of the upright (which is the average stress over the
cross-section) should be no greater than the
allowable column stress for the slenderness
ratio hu /2p. This is an attempt to take in
account a two-wave type of buckling failure that
has been observed in very slender uprights.


Forced Crippling Failure


The shear buckles in the web will force
buckling of the upright in a leg attached to the
web, particularly if the upright leg is thinner
than the web. These buckles give a lever arm to
the compressive force acting in the leg and
therefore produce a severe stress condition.
The buckles in the attached leg will in turn
induce buckling of the outstanding legs.

where, (f 1L -max. _If_ _u )_ is the value of the ratio
when the web has just buckled, Fig. Cll.21
gives the value of this ratio.

between the direction of the diagonal tension

**Cl1.18** **DIAGONAL** **SEMI-TENSION** **FIELD** **DESIGN**



In single uprights the outstanding legs are
relieved to a considerable extent by virtue of
the fact that the compressi V3 stress,jec reases
with distance from the web; the allowable
stresses for single uprights are therefore
somewhat higher than those for double uprights.
Because the forced crippling is of local
nature, it is assumed to depend on the peak
valile fumax. of the upright stress rather than
on the average value.


The upright stress at which final collapse
occurs is obtained by the following empirical
method:

(1) Comnute" the allowable value of F 1L
~Ilax.
for a perfectly, elastic upright material by
the formula:

For 2024-T3 Al~minum Alloy:

Fu=21000k2/3(tu/t)1/3(For double uprights)-(61a)

Fu=26000k2/3(tu/t)1/3(For single uprights)·-(Slb)


For 7075-T6 Aluminum Alloy:

_Fu=26000k2/3(tu/t)1/3(For_ double uprights)-(61c)

_Fu=32500k2/3(tu/t)1/3(For_ single uprights)-(6ld)


(2) If Fu exceeds the proportional limit
for the upright material, use as allowable
valile the stress correspondin.g to the compressive strain _Fu/E._


Fu can also be obtain.ed for various
materials from Fig. Cll.38.


Natural Crippling Failure


The term "natural crippling failure" is
used to denote a crippling failure resulting
from a compressive stress unifor~ly distributed
over the cross-section of the upright. By this
definition it can occur only in double uprights.
To avoid natural crippling failure, the peak
stress in the upright F ll 'lila _ x: - in the upright
ShOllld be less than the crippling stress of the
section for Lip -+ O. It appears that crippling
failure does not appear to be a controlling
factor in actual designs.


General Elastic Instability of Web and Uprights


Test experience so far has not indicated
that general elastic instability need be considered in design. Apparently the web system
is safe against general elastic instability if
the uprights are designed to fail by column
action or by forced crippling at a shear load
not much less than the shear strength of the
web.



**Cl1.23** **Web** **Design.**


For design purposes, the peak value of the
nominal web shear stress within a bay is taken

as,


                                 (62)


Refer to Figs. Cll.23 and Cll.24 to
determine values of factors C1 and C2• The C1
term constitutes a correction factor to allow
for the angle _a_ of the diagonal tension field
differing from 45 degrees. C2 makes allowance
for the stress concentration due to the flexibility of the beam flanges.


Allowable Shea, Stress Fs .


The allowable shear stress Fs is determined
by tests and depends on the value of the
diagonal-tension factor k as well as on the
details of the web to flange and web to upright
fastenings. Fi~. Cll.25 gives empirical allowabhJ curves for two aluminum alloys. It Should
be noted that these curves contain an allowance
for the rivet factor; inclusion of this factor
in these curves is possible because tests have
shown that the ultimate shear stress based on
the gross section (that is, without reduction
of rivet holes) is almost constant within the
normal range of rivet factor (CR> 0.6).


For the allowable stress for other
materials refer to Fig. Cll.42.


Permanent BucklinG; of Web.


A check for the development of permanent
shear buckles can be made using Fig. Cll.46.
In this figure F sP .B. is the allowable web
gross shear stress for no permanent buckles.
The Air Force usually specifies no permanent
buckles at limit load.


**Cl1.24** **Rivet** **Design.**


Web to Flange Rivets


The load per inch run acting on web to
flange rivets is taken as,


R" = ~~ (1 + 0.414 k)   -   -   - (63)


With double uprights the web to upright
rivets must provide sufficient longitUdinal
shear strength to make the two uprights act as
an integral unit until column failure occurs.
The total shear strength (single shear strength
of all rivets) required in an upright is



R = ---,,...-=--::~::-,:::... 2 F co Q hu

The rivets must also have sufficient
tensile strength to prevent the buckled sheet
from lifting off the stiffener. The necessary
strength is given by the criterion.

where Ftu is the tensile strength of the web.

(The tensile strength of a rivet is defined as
the tenSile load that causes any failure; if
the sheet is thin failure will consist in the
pulling of the rivet through the sheet.)


No criterion for shear strength of the
rivets on single uprights has been established;
the criterion for tensile strength is probably
adequate to insure a satisfactory design.


The pitch of trle rivets on single uprights
should be small enough to prevent inter-rivet
buckling of the web (or the upright leg if
thinner than the web), at a compressive stress
equal to f umax. The pitch shOUld also be less
than d/4 in order to justify the assumption

Where C 3 is a factor given in Fig. Cll.24. The

moment and exists at the ends of the bay over
the uprights. If C 3 and k are near unity, the
mmnent in the middle of the bay is half as
large as that given by formula (69) and of
opposite sign.

The theoretical effective shear modulus of
a web Ge in partial diagonal tension is given
in Figs. Cll.26a and C1I.26b. In Fig. Cll.26a,

For our beam t u the leg thickness of the

Calculation of the Critical Shear Stress (F scr )


Use will be made of Fig. Cll.17,


dc _ 10 400 ::: Stiffener spacing (See Fig.
t - .025 = Web thickness Cll.16)


hc = 27.94 :::
dc 10 2.79, See Fig. Cll.16 for hc '


Using the above values, we find from Fig.
Cll.17 that


Fs cr = 370 psi.

Calculation of the Loading Ratio fs/F scr


From equation 55


Sw 13500
fs = het = 29.45 x .025 ::: 18350 psi.


where, Sw = external shear load on web.
he = distance between flange centroids.


Equation 55 was used because the flanges
will take very little of the shear load.


Therefore the loading ratio,


f
_s_ = 18350 = 49 6
F 370   Scr


Calculation of Diagonal-Tension Factor k


With fs/F scr ::: 49.6, we use Fig. Cll.19 to
find value of k ::: .69, for zero curve since
sheet is flat or R = O.


Calculation of Average Stress in Upright


Upright consists of one 1 x 1 x 1/8, 2024
extruded angle section.


To obtain effective area, we use eq. 58


Au .234
Au = ::: = [.112]
e 1 + (~)2 P 1 + [( .3025)2] .29


where,


Au ::: area of web upright or stiffener
e ::: distance from median plane of web
to centroid of single upright.
p ::: centroidal radius of gyration of
cross section of upright about axis
parallel to web.


Using Fig. Cll.20, with Aue/dt = ~1~0~~1_~~~~2~5

= .45 and k = .69, we obtain value of fu/f s =
.92.



Hence, f u = 18350 x .92 = 16900 psi, which
represents the average stress over the length of
the upright but applies only along the median
plane of the web or along the line of rivets
connecting upright to web.


Calculation of Maximum Stress Upright


d 10
Value of hu = 28.50 = .352


where, d = upright spacing
hu ::: distance between centroids of upright-flange rivet connections.


Using .352 as value of d/fiu and k ::: .69, we find
from Fig. Cll.21 that fUrnax/fu = 1.17. Hence,


f umax . ::: -16900 x 1.17 = -19800 psi.


Calculation of Diagonal Tension Angle _a_


From Fig. Cll.22 for values of k ::: .69 and
fu/f s ::: 16900/18350 ::: .92, we obtain tan _a_ :::
.815.


Calculation of Allowable stresses for Upright


Check allowable stress for failure as a
column:

Since the design is of the single upright
type, we check the following two criteria:

(1) Stress fu should be no greater than
the column yield stress for the upright material.


In the previous solution of this beam by
Method 1, the crippling stress of the web upright was calculated to be -52500 psi., which
corresponds to the column yield stress Fco .
Since fu (average) was -16900 psi., the upright
is far overstrength for this particular strength
check.


(2) The stress at the centroid of the upright should be no greater than the allowable
column stress for a slenderness ratio of
hu /2p ::: 28.50/2 x .29 ::: 49


The Johnson-Euler column equation is,

F 2
Fc ::: F cs   - 4 ~~ E (L' /p)2


52500 [2]
Fc ::: 52500 - 4 n2 x 10,700,000 (49)2 :::

-38000 psi


M.S. = (38000/16900) - 1 ::: 1.14.


Allowable stress for Upright for Forced
Crippling


For a single member upright equation (6lb)
applied.


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-797-full.png)

Fu = 26000 k [a ] / [3] (tU/t)~/3


Fu = 26000 X .69 [2 ] / [3] (.125/.025)~/3 =
34600 psi


The F cy for 2014-T6 Ext. = 53000


Correcting from F cy = 42000 for 2024
material by directly as the V of the yield
stresses, which is approximately true, we
obtain,


Fu = (42000)~la (57000)~/a x 34600 - 38800_ psi


M.S. = (38800/19800) - 1 = 0.96


The stress is below the proportional limit
stress of the material so no correction is

necessary.


The stress Fu could also be found by use
of curves in Fig. Cll.38.


The web stiffener or upright is too much
overstrength and should be re-designed.


Check Web Design


The peak value of the nominal web shear
stress within a beam bay is taken as,


From Fig. Cll.23 using tan a = .815, we
find C~ = .022.


Using Fig. Cl1.24, we must finel value of term


4r- _
wd = 0.7 d _J_ t before the value of
(Ic + IT) he

Ca can be found.


4r- _
wd = 0.7 x 10 _J_ .025 = 1.96
(.1075 + .0291) 29.45


hence from Fig. Cll.24, Ca = .075


Substituting:

f smax. = 18350 (1 + .69 x .022)(1 + .69 x .075)

**=** **19600** **psi.**


Allowable Web Shear Stress


From Fig. Cll.25a for k = .69, the allowable F sall . for 24ST (Ftu = 62000 psi.) equals

21000 psi for web without rivet washer and
23700 psi for web with rivet washer. The
margin of safety for web with rivets without
washer is (21000/19600) - 1 = .07. For rivets
with washer the margin of safety would be



**Cll.21**


(23700/19600) - 1 = .21.

These values are practically the same as by
the first method of solution in Art. Cll.13.


Single shear strength of 5/32 2117-T3 rivet

Strength per rivet pitch = 2 x 486 = 972 lb.
M.S. = (972/456) - 1 = 1.12


Web to Upright Rivets


The required tensile strength is given by
the criterion, that the tensile strength of
rivets per inch of stiffener should be greater
than 0.22 to F t4 which equals 0.22 x .025 x
62000 = 340 Ib./inch.


In our rivet problems we have specified no
web-stiffener rivets. Thus rivets should be
specified that will develop 340 lb. tension
strength per inch of stiffener. See Fig.
Cll.37a for tension strength for some fastenerskin combinations. Refer to further

The web uprights are fastened to the flange
both upper and lower by 1/4 dia. AN steel bolt.


The load on the upright at its ends is,
Pu = f u Au e = 16900 x .112 = -1895 lb.

Shear strength of 1/4 bolt = 3681.


Bearing on vertical 3/32 leg of lower flange
= 1.25 x 2340 = 2930 lb. (critical).


M.S. = (2930/1895) - 1 = .54


Since a 1/4" dia. rivet A17ST, F su = 38 ksi
has a shear strength of 1970 lb. it could be
used instead of the 1/4" bolt and the M.S. would

be .04.

bending moment = 50 x 13500 = 675000" lb.
Diagonal tension factor = .69
Thus bending moment developed as a shear resistant beam = (1 - .69) 675000 = 209000" lb.


The remainder of the bending moment is
developed as a pure tension field beam, or a
moment of 466000" lb.

Comparing these values with the values obtained

by the first method of solution we find -44000
and 42450 respectively. Thus the NACA method

Average Axial Flange Loads Due to Bending


As a shear resistant beam average axial
flange load equals


I - IW M (1 - k)
( I ) ( he )


where M (1 - k) = 675000 (1 - .69) = 209000" lb.

This compares with 3210 in. lb. by the first
method of solution. The flange stresses could
be found as in sol~tion method 1.


**Cll.28** General Conclusion.


In general the NACA method gives higher
margins of safety. The NACA method is recommended for actual design of semi-tension field
beams. The NACA method has been extended to
cover r,urved webs and this subject is presented
in Part 2 of this chapter.


In the example problem the web was
relatively thin and the diagonal tension factor
k of .69 means that wrinkling is quite severe
as 69 percent of the shear load is carried by
diagonal tension. In heavily loaded and rather
shallow depth beams, such as wing spars or wing
bulkheads SUbjected to large external loads,
the webs are much thicker and the k factor

much less.


The great saving in web weight over that
required for a non-buckling web design easily
exceeds the weight increase in the flanges and
the web uprights that diagonal tension field
action produces. The rivet design in semitension field design presents more detailed
design problems since the rivet loads are larger

Cll.23


and more complex than for a beam with non- w = k q cot a
buckling web. = .69 (18,350x .025) x 1.228 = 388 Ib./in.



Cll.29 End Bay Effects.


The previous discussion has been concerned
with the "interior" bays of a beam. The
vertical stiffeners in these areas are SUbject,
primarily, to only axial compression loads, as
discussed. The outer or "end bay" is a special
case. Since the diagonal tension effect
results in an inward pull on the end stiffener,
it produces bending in it, as well as the usual
compression axial load. This action can be
clearly seen in Fig. Cll.27. Obviously, the
end stiffener must be considerably heavier than
the others, or at least supported by additional
members to reduce the stresses due to bending.


Actually an end bay effect exists wherever
a buckled panel ends and structural members
along the edge of the panel must carry the
bending due to the diagonal tension loads.


Typical examples, in addition to the end
stiffener discussed, would be the edge members
bordering a cut-out or a non-structural ctoor
in a flat beam, or a curved fuselage or wing
panel. Illustrations are shown in Fig. Cll.27.

(a) (b)


Fig. Cll.27


The component of the running load per inch
that produces bending in such edge members is
given by the formulas


w = k q tan a


for edge members parallel to the neutral axis
(stringers) and


w = k q cot a


for members normal to the neutral axis
(stiffeners or rings). The longer the unsupported length of the edge member SUbjected
to w, the greater will be the bending moment it
must carry.


For example, consider the end stiffener of
the beam of Fig. Cll.13 in Art. Cll.13. Using
the data from Art. Cll.27,


|7.|6"|

This is a severe loading for the end
stiffener to carry in bending in addition to its
other loads. A heavy member would be required.


There are in general 3 ways of dealing with
the edge member SUbjected to bending, the object
being to keep the weight down.

(3 )


Actually
be best.



Simply "beef-up" or strengthen the
edge member so it can carryall of its
loads (this is inefficient for long
unsupported lengths).


Increase the thickness of the end bay
panel to either make it non-buckling
or to reduce k and thereby the running
load producing bending in the edge
member (this is usually inefficient
for large panels).


Provide additional member (stiffeners)
to support the edge member and thereby
reduce its bending moment due to w.
(this requires additional parts).


a combination of these methods might



Consider method (3) above. This will sometimes increase the local shear in the bay and
should be considered. Assume that 3 additional
stiffeners are added (equally spaced in this
case) to support the end stiffener against
bending and analyze the end bay internal loads
resulting for the beam of Fig. Cll.13 and the
analysis used for it in Art, Cll.27 (NACA
Method) .


Fig. Cll.28a shows the end bay and the
loads applied to it.

Note that in Fig. (a) there are two sets
of applied loads. One is the basic applied
shear load of 13,500 lb. and the other is the
component of the tension field load, w,
calculated as 388 lb./in. earlier in this
article.


Fig. (b) shows the shear flows in the end
bay panels, taken as constant in all the panels,
due to the 13,500 lb. load applied. The shear
flows are shown as they act on the edge members.


Fig. (c) shows the shear flows in the
panels due to the applied load w. Average shear
flows (in the center of each panel) are shown.
Actually the shear flow in the end bay will
29.45
vary from a maximum of q = 388 x 2 x 10 = 571

lb./in. to 0 lb./in. at the center. The values
of this variation at the center of each bay are
shown for analysis purposes.


In Fig. (d) the load systems of (b) and (c)
are added to obtain the final (preliminary)
loads. It can be seen here that the shear flow
in the upper two panels of the end bay is
significantly increased over the nominal value



13,500
of q = 29.45 = 457 lb./in. existing in the

other bays of the beam. This means that the
diagonal tension effects in this area will be
greater (for the same web thickness) and must
be considered locally here in checking the
upper flange, the end stiffener, the added
support stiffeners, the rivets, the web, etc.


Having determined the basic internal loads,
the members involving the end bay can be
checked for strength using the methods and data
of Art. Cll.14 to Cll.26. When, as in the case
of the upper added support stiffener, the shear
flows are different in the adjacent bays,
average values of q and k should be used in
checking the stiffener for strength. Formula
57 assumes equal shears in adjacent bays.


In general, there is no simple analytical
way of calculating exact tension field load
variations when shear flows vary from panel to
panel in a structural network. The procedure
outlined above is but an elementary "approximation" that can be used for design purposes.
If all margins are near zero, SUbstantiating
element tests are in order.

The following will now happen due to the
presence of P.



1.



The stringers Will, of course, have to
carry the compressive load, P, which will
be divided among them. There will be some
"effective" skin to help.

2. Less obvious, but very important, is the
fact that the diagonal tension loads due
to the torsion, T, will be considerably
affected by the presence of the axial load,
P. The larger P is, with respect to T,
the greater will be its effect upon the
diagonal tension effects. This is as
follows.


a) The skin panels will now buckle at a
lower amount of applied torsion since
they are now also strained axially in
compression. Actually there is a "combined" buckling consisting of compression and shear buckling. This can be
obtained from an interaction equation,
discussed later.


b) Since the critical shear buckling stress
is now lower the diagonal tension
factor, k, is larger.


c) All of the diagonal tension effects
dependent upon k are increased. These
include the axial loads induced in the
stringers., the normal loads bending the
stringers inward, the loads induced in
the rings and the loads felt by the
fasteners.


d) The angle of diagonal tension will be
larger, closer to 45 [0 ]      

Thus we see that the effect of compression is to
increase the loads due to diagonal tension.


Now assume that instead of being compression, the axial load, P, is tension. In this
case, the effects of diagonal tension, due to
T, are reduced.


1. The stringers and skin feel tension due to
P, which opposes compression due to diagonal
tension.



5.



stringers, coming entirely from (3) above,
and is thus concentrated at points. This
concentration produces not only compression
but also internal bending moments in the
floating rings. This is shown in Fig.
Cll.30e.


Any fasteners splicing skins together or
fastening the skins to the end rings feel
not only a shear panel type of loading but
also a normal loading, as in the case of a
plane web beam. Also, the "folds" in the
skin due to the diagonal buckles pry on
the rivets as they "attempt" to extend
across the rivet lines at the stringers
anci rings.



The important thing to realize here is
that, although only a pure torsion has been
applied, considerable axial loads have been
generated in the stringers and rings. And
even some bending moments have been induced in
the stringers and in the rings of the "floating"
type.


Now, assume that at the same time the
torsion load is being applied an increasing

**PART** **2.** **CURVED WEB SYSTEMS.**

(BY w. F. McCOMBS)



**Cll.** 30 Diagonal Tension in Curved Web Systems Introduction.


Thi3 type of structure has an important
place in the design of light metal structures.
The structural designer should have as good an
understanding of it as he must have for the
someNhat,simpler plane web system. Actually,
most airframe shear web systems are curved
rather than fl::lt, the fusel::lge of a modern
aircraft being tlw oustanding example. To make
a fuselage skin entirely non-buckling would
require a very thi~k skin and/or a closely
spaced sUbstructure supporting it. This would
involve a considerable weis;ht penalty compared
to the buckling skin arrangement. The typical
metal skin in a modern fighter or transport
airplane thus carries its limit and ultimate
loads with a considerable degree of skin
buckling. In view of thi:3, the need for an
understanding of diagonal tension effects in
curved web systems is obVious.



are present. Comparing this structure to a
plane web beam, the stringers correspond to the
flanges, the rings correspond to the uprights
and the skin corresponds to the web. ThUS, the
stringers carry (or resist) aXial loads. The
rings support the stringers ano, if not of the
"floating" type, also divide the skin panels
into shorter lengths. The skin carries (or
reSists) shear loads.


Now, assume the structure to be SUbjected
to a pure torsion, T, as shown in Fig. Cll.29.
Before the skin buckles, this torsion produces
a shear in the skin panels given by the well_knoNn_ formula


T
q::   2A


Only the skin is loaded. As in the case of the
uprights of a plane web beam, the rings are not
loaded. There is no load in the stringers.



Cll.3l General Discussion.



As the torsion is increased, however, the
skin shear stress eventually becomes larger

of design, than the critical buckling stress and the panels
in a buckle. Any further increase in torsion must
is helpful. now be carried as diagonal tension. Five main
with a things then occur as the torsion is increased
shape above the buckling value, as illustrated in

Fig. Cl1.30.

Before getting into the details of design,
a general discussion of what happens in a
cilrved web system as the web buckles is helpful.
Consider a semi-monocoque structure with a
circular (or elliptical) cross-sectional shape
as shown in Fig. Cll.29.

1.



The skin panels buckle and flatten out
between' rings fastened to the skin, from
their original curved shape. This gives a
polygonal cross-section (away from a ring).
The angle of diagonal tension is less than
that for a plane web beam, however, in the
range of 20 [0] - 30 [0 ] .

2.



The stringers now feel an axial load, due
to the pulling on the ends, (CIl.30b), of
the structure by the buckled skin, just
as in the case of the plane web beam.


The stringers also feel a normal loading
that tends to bend, or "bow", them inward
between supporting rings, as shown in
Fig. Cl1.30c.


The supnorting rings feel an inward loading
which puts them in "hoop" compression. For
rings attached to the skin this loading is
applied by the stringers ano the skin, and
is thus "spread out". For floating rings
this loading is applied only by the

and "longerons" if they are few in number, say
3 to 8) which are supported by frames or rings
and covered With a skin. The rings may b-e---attached to the skin and "notched" to let the 4.
stringers pass through, as in Fig. (b), or they
may be located entirely under the stringers and
not, therefore, attached to the skin. In this
latter case they are called "floating" rings,
as in Fig. (c). Sometimes both types of rings

compressive axial load, P, is being applied,
simultaneously, as shown in Fig. Cll.31.

The following will now happen due to the
presence of P.

The stringers Will, of course, have to
carry the compressive load, P, which will
be divided among them. There will be some
"effective" skin to help.

2. Less obvious, but very important, is the
fact that the diagonal tension loads due
to the torsion, T, will be considerably
affected by the presence of the axial load,
P. The larger P is, with respect to T,
the greater will be its effect upon the
diagonal tension effects. This is as
follows.


a) The skin panels will now buckle at a
lower amount of applied torsion since
they are now also strained axially in
compression. Actually there is a "combined" buckling consisting of compression and shear buckling. This can be
obtained from an interaction equation,
discussed later.


b) Since the critical shear buckling stress
is now lower the diagonal tension
factor, k, is larger.


c) All of the diagonal tension effects
dependent upon k are increased. These
include the axial loads induced in the
stringers., the normal loads bending the
stringers inward, the loads induced in
the rings and the loads felt by the
fasteners.


d) The angle of diagonal tension will be
larger, closer to 45 [0 ]      

Thus we see that the effect of compression is to
increase the loads due to diagonal tension.


Now assume that instead of being compression, the axial load, P, is tension. In this
case, the effects of diagonal tension, due to
T, are reduced.


1. The stringers and skin feel tension due to
P, which opposes compression due to diagonal
tension.

stringers, coming entirely from (3) above,
and is thus concentrated at points. This
concentration produces not only compression
but also internal bending moments in the
floating rings. This is shown in Fig.
Cll.30e.


Any fasteners splicing skins together or
fastening the skins to the end rings feel
not only a shear panel type of loading but
also a normal loading, as in the case of a
plane web beam. Also, the "folds" in the
skin due to the diagonal buckles pry on
the rivets as they "attempt" to extend
across the rivet lines at the stringers
anci rings.



The important thing to realize here is
that, although only a pure torsion has been
applied, considerable axial loads have been
generated in the stringers and rings. And
even some bending moments have been induced in
the stringers and in the rings of the "floating"
type.


Now, assume that at the same time the
torsion load is being applied an increasing


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-807-full.png)

2. The ski~ panels can carry a larger shear
stress before buckling in shear. In fact,
a relatively small amount of axial tension
can prevent them from buckling at all, as
will be discussed later.


3. The diagonal tension factor, k, will be
smaller (or zero if no buckling occurs).


4. All diagonal tension effects dependent
upon k are reduced and the diagonal tension
angle is smaller.


Finally, suppose that instead of an axial
load, P, a bending moment is being applied
simultaneously with the torsion, T, as in Fig.
Cl1.32.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-807-0.png)


In this case, also, as the torsion is being
increased from a small mount, M is also being
increased, (the ratio of M to T being constant,
as was the case for axial load, Pl. Then,
from the usual bending theory, f = Mz, the
I
following will occur.


1. The stringers (and skin) above the neutral
axis will feel compression loads, the
further away the greater the load. The
upper skin panels will thus buckle earlier
in combined compression and shear and
produce the largest diagonal tension loads
on the stringers and rings.


2. The skins below the neutral axis will
buckle later (or not at all) due to the
tension strain produced by M. Thus the
diagonal tension effects will be smaller
(or non-existant) in the rings and
stringers in this region.


3. The skins near the neutral axis will feel
little or no strains due to bending and
will buckle about as in the case for the
pure torsion, T, producing equivalent
effects.


In an actual airplane structure, a fuselage
for example, the a~plied loading is more
complex. Instead of simply an applied torsion,
there is also, usually, a vertical and perhaps
a sideward set of loads which produce shears
that vary from panel to panel. And there may
be not only a bending moment, which changes,
along the fuselage, but also axial loads due to



Cll.31


landings, catapulting requirements, etc.
Obviously all of this complicates the calculations,and experience and jUdgment are of
great help; but the method of going about it
is fundamental and will now be discussed.


The N.A.C.A. has conducted an extensive
program over the years With the object of
determining a system for the design of
structures having curved webs in diagonal
tension. The theory for this system, as in
the case for the plane web beam, was given by
Wagner and others and modified as necessary
from the results of many tests. The design
method is fully discussed in Ref. (3) and the
substantiating test program in Ref. (4). The
reader is encouraged to consult these references for a fuller presentation of the
theoretical deve10pment and test results.


As mentioned earlier, curved web systems
are of two general types. One of these has an
arrangement which results in the web, or skin,
panels being longer in the aXial direction, d,
than in the circumferential direction, h.
This is typical of the stringer system in a
fuselage, as shown in Fig. CIl.33.


~:> 1.0

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-807-1.png)


Fig. Cll.33


That is, the geometry of the stringer spacing,
h, and the ring spacing, d, is such that


"Floating" rings, not being attached to the skin,
do not determine the spacing, d.


A second type of curved web structure may
be referred to as the longeron system. Its main
characteristic is that the skin panels are long
in the circumferential direction. This type of
structure would, typically, in a fuselage, consist of a few axial members (a minimum of 3 but
more usually 4 to 8 for a "fail safe" design)
and a large number of closely spaced frames.
The frames would, in this system, be at about a
4" to 6" spacing as compared to a 15"-20" spacing for a stringer system. This gives

**Fig.** **Cll.34**


In the longer on system the frames are attached
to the skin and longerons~ there are no
"floating" rings.


Most of the NACA data and design method is
for the stringer system. The design method for
the longeron system, also presented herein,
has evolved from Ref. (3) and also from the
results of an investigation and test program
at Chance-Vought Aircraft Corp. These latter
checks are in some places different from the
ones in the stringer system. The main problem
is the determination of the angle of diagonal
tension, for either system" Once this is known
all of the diagonal tension stresses are known.


The stringer system will be discussed
first and the longeron system will be discussed
secondly. The basic approach is similar to
that for plane web beams.


**Cll.32** **Analysis** **of Stringer** **Systems** **in Diagonal Tension.**


Before the diagonal tension effects can
be calculated, the primary internal loads in
the structure, due to the applied loads, must
be determined. This can be done as discussed
in Chapter A20. The engineers theory of bending
can usually be used to determine the axial
loads in the stringers, as in Art. A20.2-A20.5.
The shear flows in the various skin panels can
be determined as in A20.6-A20.8. In the case
of stringer construction a more accurate
determination of the skin shear flows may, if
desired, be obtained if the skin panels are
cons i,jered flat, rather than curved, between
stringers. This is because the panels, after
buckling, actually flatten out, giving a
polygonal cross-sectional shape, except
illL"Uediately adjacent to non-floating rings, as
shown in Fig. Cll.30a.



where simple support is usually conservatively
assQmed in determining ks '


When axial loads (and strains) are present,
as in practical structures subjected to bending
as well as shear, the situation is more complicated. As discussed in Chapter C9, the presence
of compressive stresses together with shear
stresses causes the panel to buckle at a lower
value of shear than if no compression were
present. The presence of tension stresses,
along with shear stresses, enables the panel to
stand larger shear stresses before buckling
occurs. In fact, a relatively small amount of
tension stress may prevent the panel from ever
buckling in shear.


It is important to determine the actual
shear buckling stress when axial stresses,
particularly compression, are present. The
reason is that this affects the diagonal tension
factor, k, and all of the ensuing stresses
affected by k.


First consider a shear panel SUbjected to
a shear stress f s and a compression stress f c '
It has been demonstrated experimentally at the
NAC!\., Ref. (.5) that a curved panel, thusly
loaded, buckles according to the interaction
formula


1.0            - - - - - - - (71)


where FCcr and F Scr are the critical panel
buckling stresses for pure compression and pure
shear respectively. From Chapter C9, the
buckling stress for a curved sheet panel, in
end compression is given by the equation,


Now for any particular panel,


F
Ccr
----- F   - A, (a constant)   - - - - - - - (72)
scr    


The diagonal tension effects can now be and
evaluated.



**1.** DET8RMINATION OF CRITICAL BUCKLING STRESS
OF SKI'.\! PANELS.


The buckling strength of curved panels
under pure shear and compressive stresses is
covered in Chapter C9. The equation for
buckling shear stress Fs cr is,



Now, also for any given applied loading condition being checked we can calculate ---

f c (= MIZ) at the center of the panel (before

buckling) and also f s (previously done). These
stresses will bear a constant ratio to each
other until buckling occurs, after which the


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-809-full.png)

compression stress no longer increases. Thus
we can write


f c
    - f    - B    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - (73)
s 

or f c = B f s


SUbstitutIng these formulas for F Ccr and f c
back into the interaction fonnula (71) we
obtain,


Solving this quadratic for f s we get


                                -                                -                                -                                (74)

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-809-0.png)


where fs is the actual shear stress at which
the panel buckles due to the presence of
compression stresses. Calling this stress
f s cr and calling the expression in the brackets
R c


f Scr = F Scr Rc     - - (75)


where Rc is always less than 1.0 whAn
compression stresses are present.



Cll.33


Since RT is always greater than 1.0 when tension
stresses are present, the actual shear buckling
stress will always be greater than Fs cr,the
buckling stress for pure shear loads only.
Inspection of the term in parenthesis in (78)
making up RT shows that as the tension stress
becomes several times larger than Fe the
cr
value of f s cr will become several times larger
than F scr - Thus, if ft is large enough no
buckling will occur even when large shear
stresses are present.


2. DIAGONAL TENSION FACTOR, k.


The next step is the determination of the
diagonal tension factor, k. This is a function
of -f---where, f s as discussed above,

scr


or f = F R
scr scr T


depending upon whether compression or tension
stresses are present.


For a curved panel the formula for k, as
determined from much test data, Ref. (3) is the
empirical relationship,


k = tanh [(.5 + 300 ~~) lOg10~]    - (80)
scr



Next, consider a shear panel sUbjected to
a shear stress, f s, and a tension stress, ft.
For this case it has been experimentally
demonstrated, Ref. (6), that the interaction with the auxiliary rules that
relationship defining buckling is

a) if ~ >- 2 use only 2

with the auxiliary rules that

b)

use only 2.



where Fs cr and Fc cr are as previously discussed.


The shear stress, f s, at which the panel will
buckle when the tension stress present is ft
can be solved for directly from equation (76),


f
-- F Scr = 1.0 + 2F ft  -  -  -  -  -  - -  -  - (77)
Scr ccr


or,


f
t
f Scr = (1.0 + -2--) FCcr Fs cr     - - - - - - (78)


Calling the expression in parenthesis in (78)
RT we get,


f Scr = F Scr RT     - - - - - - - - - - - (79)



Rather than calculate k from the formula, it
can more easily be obtained from Fig. Cll.19.


3. STRINGER LOADS, STRESSES, AND STRAINS


As in the case of the plane web system, the
total stringer load will consist of the primary
axial loads, Pp, due to applied bending moments
and/or axial loads, plus the diagonal tension
induced loads, PD.T.


                 - - - - - - (81)


Pp is determinAd as in Chapter A20.2-A20.5.
PD.T. is determined, similarly to the case for
the flanges of a plane web beam, from the
"pulling" of the buckled skin on the end
frames.

or tension is present. Again, k and Rc or RT

~~·~~;l.lb~~Xhb side of the stringer. Thus we can write



![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-810-0.png)

Fig. Cll.35


As shown in Fig. Cll.35, PD.T. is the
diagonal tension load in a stringer bounded by
panel "a" on one side and panel "b" on the
other. Let the width of panel (a) be ha and
the width of panel (b) be hb. (For equally
spaced stringers, of course, ha = hb ). Let the
shear flow in panel (a) be ~ and that in panel
(b) be qb. Then we can write

= ka qa ha cot o.a + ~ qb ~ cot o.b

PD•T • 2 .2


                      - (82)


To keep the calculations simpler (as will be
appreciated later) we can accept some inaccuracy and use average values for the

Qa + qb
respective terms ( [%] [ +] 2 [ hb] 2' etc.) and

get


Pn.T. = k q h cot a.   - - - - - - - - (83)


remembering that this is an "average" load,
which, for closely spaced stringers, is
sufficient, especially for preliminary design.
The total stringer load is then, from 80 and 82


PSTR = Pp + k q h cot a.


where all terms are known except a..


The stringer stress is obtained by
dividing the terms on the right side by their
respective effective areas


fSTR. = PSTR = Pp + k q h cot a.
A Ae A eD T      -      p


a) Aep is the total effective area, stringer

and skin, used in determining the primary loads
as in Chapter A20. If Pp is tension the area
is equal to ht, panel is fully effective.



or

fSTR = A STR + A eSKIN A STR + .5ht (1- k)Rc,T


Pp k f s cot a.
f STR = -:"A-S-TR-+"""-;A:--e-S-K-IN- + """"'A-S-T-R----==-------lit + .5(1- k)R c T '

Ref. (3)     - - - - - - - - - - (84)



where all terms are known on the right hand
side of the equation except a..


The total stringer strain is then


f
STR
E STR = -E-   -   -   -   -   -   - (86)


If fSTR is larger than the proportional limit
stress, or in the neighborhood of the yield
stress, E is not a constant and a stress strain
diagram should be used to read E directly, using
fSTR. Again, fSTR. and hence ESTR. cannot be
determined until a. is known (later).


There is also a secondary loading on the
stringer which tends to bend or "'bow" it inward.
This is caused by the fact that the taut skins
are pulled flat on each side of the stringer.
Thus as in Fig. Cll.30 there is an inward
component of the skin diagonal tension loading
that pulls the stringer inward. This loading
is not a simply distributed one; it is largest
in the middle of the stringer and becomes
smaller at the supports. Ref. (3) recommends
that the effect of this loading be considered
as producing secondary bending moments in the
stringer, taken as


fs ht d 2 k tan a.
MsTR = 24R   -   -   -   -   -   - (87)
R = radius of curv.

This represents a "peak" moment at the middle
and at the ring supports. It will produce
tension on the inside of the stringer at the
middle and compression on the inside of the
stringer at the supports. The recommended
value of MsTR is the result of many test
measurements, therefore it is of a semiempirical nature.


4. STRESSES AND STRAINS IN RINGS


There are two types of rings, those attached
to the skin and those not attached to the skin,
called "floating rings," which support, and are
therefore loaded only by, the stringers.



Rings attached to the skin are usually
Ref. (3) suggests a more accurate calculation. "notched" to let the stringers pass through.


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-811-full.png)

**Cll,35**


(91)



The stringers are attached to these rings
locally by some shear clip arrangement. The
rings feel an inward acting loading which puts
them in "hoop compression". These loads come
from the stringers and from the skin. The
stringer being pulled inward by the skin, as
described above and in Fig. Cll.30, in turn
pushes inward on the supporting rings. The
skin, not being flat at the ring, also pulls
inward on the ring. The result of all of this
is, essentially, according to Ref. (3) a hoop
compression stress in the ring for the case of
a cylinder under pure torsion. This is because
the loading is approximately equivalent to an
evenly distributed inward acting radial loading.
For this case the radial loading can be taken
as, per inch along the ring,


f s dt k tan a

where all terms on the right hand side are known

The axial (hoop) compression load in the ring
will then be



                          -                           -                           -                           -                           -                           -                           
12R (93)

R = radius of curv.

This occurs at the junction with the stringer.
There is a secondary moment, half as large,
midway between stringers in the ring.



I'RG = pR .. f s dt k tan a



(88)



The axial compression stress in the ring will be

where all terms on the right are known except a.


The axial strain in the ring will be



fRG

=-E



- (90)



where fRG and hence ERG are unknown until a is
determined.


When loads other than pure torsion are
applied f s and k will vary from panel to panel
and the hoop compression stress will not be
constant around the ring. There will also be
some varying secondary shear stresses in the
panel due to unequal "pulls" on each side of
the panel, at the stringer, by the buckled skin.


When "floating" rings are used concentrated
inward acting radial loads are applied by the
stringers. This produces hoop compression and,
since all the loads are concentrated, also
some bending moments. There is, of course, no
effective skin acting with these rings. 'rhe
axial compression load is


PD.T. = fs dt k tan a



5. STRAINS IN THE SKIN PANELS


The strain in the skin panels is given in
Ref. (3) as


E = E f S [ sin 2k 2a + sin 2a (l-k)(l+u) ]


                          -                           -                           -                           -                           -                           -                           (94)


where u = Poisson's Ratio = .32 for aluminum,
every term on the right hand side of the equation
is known except a. Fig. Cll.36 is of help in
calculating E, giving the value of the bracketed
term.


6. DETERMINATION OF a*


For the stringer system (d ~ h) Ref. (3)
shows that a is related to the stringer strain,
the ring strain and the web, or skin panel,
strain by the formula


E - EST
tan 2 a =   - - - - - (95)
+ 1 (h) 2
E - ERG 24 If


R = radius of curv.
where E is a tension strain (+) and ERG and
ESTR are entered as negative members for compression, thus adding to E.


a is determined by successive approximation
using the three prior formulas for E, EST and
ERG and then checking with the formula (95)
above. That is,



The axial compression stress is then, - For a faster estimate or for preliminary design, step 6 can
be skipped for panels in compression and shear and a simply
assumed to be 45°.

Cll.36 DIAGONAL SEMI- TENSION FIELD DESIGN



1) Assume a value for _a._


2) Determine e, eRG and eSTR using this
assumed value of _a._


3) SUbstitute e, eRG and eSTR into the
formula for tan" _a_ and get a "new"
value for _a._


4) Repeat steps (1) to (3) ~s many times
(say 3) as necessary to get _a_ to a
"converged" value.


If rings attached to the skin are being
used then eRG in step (2) above is obtained
from (90), using (89) for fRG. If "floating"
rings are used then eRG is obtained from (92),
using (91) for fRG.


Once _a_ is determined, the stringer stresses
and ring stresses are known, having been used
in getting the strains eSTR and eRG for the
final check of _a_ in (95). The bending moments
in the stringers can then be calculated from
(87) and the bending moments in floating rings,
if used, from (93).


7. LOADS ON THE RIVETS


The only remaining internal loads to be
calculated are those acting on the rivets.
These are of two types.


a) There are·the primary loads, in the
plane of the skins which try to cause
shear or bearing failures at the
riveted joints, as in any spliced skin.


b) There are also, "prying" forces on the
rivets which try to "pop off" the rivet
heads or to pull the skin up and around
the rivet heads. This latter may
occur, particularly, when countersunk or dimpled skins and flush head
rivets are used and the rivet diameter
is too small or the rivet spacing is
too large. These are "secondary" loads.


The primary rivet loads occur whenever the
skin is spliced, which is usually, but not
necessarily, along a stringer or along a ring.
These loads would also be present if the skin
panel ended at stringer or ring, as at an
opening or "cut-out" and the panel had not
been re-enforced by a doubler to prevent
buckling.


At a splice parallel to a stringer the
load per inch along the rivet line is due to
the same effects as discussed for the plane
web beam. It is


Load/inch = fst [1 + k (_1_ -l)J   - - (96)
cos _a_



At a splice (or opening) along a ring (a
vertical splice) the loading is


Load/inch = f s t [l+k (Si~ a-l)J-    - (97)


Note that in either case, if the panels involved
are made non-buckling (on each side of the
splice) k = 0 and the load per inch is the same
as for a non-buckled web. It is only around
a "cut-out" or opening that the panels are made
either non-buckling or made to buckle to a
lesser extent, and this is done to "relieve"
the loading on the edge member rather than on
the rivets (see Art. Cll.29).


The second type of rivet loads, the prying
loads, are not determinable by any formula.
Ref. (3) recommends that an arbitrary criteria
be used as follows. The tensile strength of the
rivet-skin combination, FT, should be such that
it is as large as the number given by


FT per inch = .22 t FTU    - - - - (98)


where FTU is the ultimate tensile strength of
the skin or web material being used.


FT is usually most critical for flush
attachments. As an aid in getting thiS, Figs.
Cll.37a and Cll.37b give information on the
tensile strength of various rivet types and
sizes.


Cll.33 Allowable Stresses (and Interactions).


1. STRINGERS


Just as there are two types of basic loads
(and stresses) in the stringers and rings (the
primary ones and the ones due to diagonal
tension effects) there are also two types of
allowable stresses for local failure. An
interaction formula is thus used to predict
adequate strength. This is,for the stringer

Fcc ST

right hand side of equation (85).


*Fcc = the allowable crippling stress for the
stringer, obtained as in Chapter C7.

fST is the second term on the right

1) Assume a value for u.


2) Determine e, eRG and eSTR using this
assumed value of u.


3) Substitute e, eRG and eSTR into the
formula for tan Ol u and get a "new"
value for u.


4) Repeat steps (1) to (3) as many times
(say 3) as necessary to get u to a
"converged" value.


If rings attached to the skin are being
used then eRG in step (2) above is obtained
from (90), using (89) for fRG. If "floating"
rings are used then eRG is obtained from (92),
using (91) for fRG.


Once u is determined, the stringer stresses
and ring stresses are known, having been used
in getting the strains eSTR and eRG for the
final check of u in (95). The bending moments
in the stringers can then be calculated from
(87) and the bending moments in floating rings,
if used, from (93).

At a splice (or opening) along a ring (a
vertical splice) the loading is


Load/inch = f s t [l+k (Si; u-l)J-    - (97)


Note that in either case, if the panels involved
are made non-buckling (on each side of the
splice) k = 0 and the load per inch is the same
as for a non-buckled web. It is only around

Cll.33 Allowable Stresses (and Interactions).


1. STRINGERS


Just as there are two types of basic loads
(and stresses) in the stringers and rings (the
primary ones and the ones due to diagonal
tension effects) there are also two types of
allowable stresses for local failure. An
interaction formula is thus used to predict
adequate strength. This is, for the stringer

*Fcc = the allowable crippling stress for the

**Cll.37**


occurs in the ring midway between stiffeners.
Fcc is the "normal" allowable crippling stress
for the ring. If FRG >" Fcc then use Fcc for
Ji'RG'


Floating rings, not being sUbject to forced
crippling by the skin, are checked in the usual
manner for the stresses due to hoop compression
loads and the accompanying bending moment,
equations (91) and (93). The interaction
equation is,


f RG + fM _ 1 ~ 0 (101)

Fcc


fRG is a constant stress between stringer
junctions; it does not have a maximum peak as
do the rings attached to skin.


3. GENERAL INSTABILITY


A general instability check for the
stringers and skin can be made from the
empirical criteria presented in Fig. Cll.39.
This is obtained from test data and recommendations of Ref. (7) and Ref. (3). The allowables
are based upon pure torsion tests. The adequacy of the structure is checked by



FST'"



Cll.21. It is explained in the plane
web beam discussion.


the "forced crippling" (diagonal
tension effect) allowable stress for
the stringer is obtained from Fig.
Cll.38, as in the case for the
uprights in the plane web beam, or
calculated from the formulas (also
for FRG and tRG)'

26 000 k [2] / [3] (t [STR] )1/3 for 24ST

material.



F ST-,   - 32 500 k [2 ] / [3] (t t [STR] )1/3 for 75ST
WEB
material with the same restrictions
noted in Cll.22. (The total axial
stringer stress is f + fST at the
area near the suPPOr~ing rings, and
f p + fST MAX in the middle between
supports.)


The stress in the stringer due to the
bending moment, MsTR' of equation (87) can be
calculated and added to f p in the proper
manner.


Ref. (3) also suggests the stringer be
checked as a column, fUlly fixed at the
supporting rings and carrying the stress f STR '
Some allowanc6 should be made for beam column
action, due to the bending moment present in
the middle of the stringer. This can be done
using some effective loading producing the
moments discussed or by carrying some extra
margin of safety over and above the column
buckling stress.


2. RINGS


The rings have allowable stresses similar
in nature to the stringers. The interaction
equation is,


f fR~-::
-p- Fcc + F   - **1.0**   -   -   -   - -   -   -   - (100)
RG


for the case of rings attached to the skin.


f is the stress due to the ring carrying
loads gther than the tension field ones (as a
bUlkhead analysis would show). F RG is the
allowable forced cFippling stress for the ring,
obtained in the same manner as that for the
stiffener, (Fig. Cll.38),


fRGmx
f RGMAX = f RG x f obtained in the same
RG
manner as discussed for the stiffener. It

It is suggested that a respectable margin of
safety be held (M.S. ~ .15). The radii of
gyration in Fig. Cll.39 should be made assuming
the full width of sheet to act with the stringer
or ring respectively and that the sheet is flat
because the criterion was obtained under these
assumptions.


4. ALLOWABLE STRESSES IN THE SKIN (OR WEB)


Ref. (3) recommends that the allowable
stress in a web or skin be taken as, for nonflusb attachments,


f SALL . = f;ALL. (.65 + ~)     -     - (103)

where ~ = .3 tanh ARG dt + .1 tanh AST ht .' ~ can,
more easily, be read from Fig. Cll.40. f SALL is obtained from Fig. Cll.41b or Cll.41c after
obtaining uPDT from Fig. Cll.41a. Data from
tests by the Chance-Vought Aircraft Corp.
indicate that the allowable web stress can
simply be read from Fig. Cll.42. In either case,
the allowables apply to f s ' the gross stress in
the panel. The net shear stress betwe~n rivet
holes can be carried up to the ultimate shear
stress F su of the material.

Cll.38 DIAGONAL SEMI-TENSION FIELD DESIGN



Cll.34 Example Problem.


The foregoing explanation can be better
explained or clarified through the presentation
of an example problem.


Assume that we have a fuselage with a
structural arrangement as in the example proble
of A20.5 and Fig. A20.3 and A20.4 of Chapter
A20. Also, assume the moment of inertia and
neutral axis for a linear bending stress distribution to apply. These values are given on
page A20.8*. Also let it be assumed that the
supporting rings are attached to the skin and
spaced at 15". The rings are 1" x 3" x 1" 24ST
g sections, .040" in thickness (see Fig.C11.43).


An analysis will be made of stringer #3,
skin panels 2-3 and 3-4, and the ring. It is
assumed also that an axial skin splice occurs
along stringer #3 and a vertical splice along
the ring to show a check of the fasteners.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-815-0.png)


Fig. C1l. 43

First the internal loads in the stringer and
skin panels are determined. The "average"
loads at the middle of the bay will be used in
this example to get the diagonal tension
effects.


At the center of the bay,

M = 1,475,000 in. lb.
T = 634,000 in. lb.
V = 11,700 lb.


Max. stringer stress occurs at Ring b:

_ HZ .= 1,563,000 (32.9)
f PmX - -1- 2382 = 21,600 psi.


f 1,475,000 (32.9) = 20,400 psi.
PAY. = 2382


Shear flows in skin panels:

VQ T
q2-3 = -1- + 2A ' where A consists of area
of 26 tri:mgles

= 11,700[.167(38.3) + .169(36.4)t

2382


 A non-linear bending stress distribution can be used, but it
also is affected by the diagonal tension compressive stresses
and involves considerable iteration. Linear ones are often

used.



634,000


**=** **61.6** **+** **113** **=** **175** **Ib./ln.**

= 11,700[.167(38.3) + .169(36.4)+.216(32.9)]
2382


+ 113 = 96 + 113 = 209 Ib./in.


The diagonal tension effects will now be
calculated assuming average q's, bending
stresses, etc., for the panels 2-3 and 3-4.


qAV2-4 = 175 ; 209 = 192 Ib./in.


The average critical shear buckling stress
will now be calculated using equation (75).


First, if no skin buckling occurred the
average compression stress in the two panels
would be, approximately, the stress in the
stringer between them, thus


   - fCpanels = f PAV . = 20,400 psi.


then the constant, B, would be


B = ~ = 20,400 = 3.40
f s 6,000



The critical pure shear
equation from Chapter C9 is,


n [2] k E
s (.1) 2
F SCT = 12 (1 - _V_ _e_ _2 )_ b



buckling stress


From Chapter
C9, ks = 16.8.



F = n [2] x16.8xIO,600,000 (.032)2 =
scr 12 (1 - .3 [2 ] ) 7.25
3140 psi.



For pure compression the critical
stress equation from Chapter C9 is,



buckling



2
n k E
FCcr = 12 (1 - c _V_ _e_ _2_ _)_ b (t) 2



kc = 15.9 (from
Chapter C9).



Thus, A = FCcr/Fscr = 2980/3140 = .950.


Since buckling stresses are below the proportional limit stress of the material, no
plasticity correction was necessary as is
usually the case in thin walled structures.
Thus stress ratio (A) could be obtained directly
as kc/k s .

From Fig. Cll.19, k = .75


The expressions for stringer and ring
stresses can now be written in terms of _a:_
Substituting into equation (85) and using f PAV
for the first term on the right side,


f STR [. = 20] [ 400+], (7.25~~~032)+·5(1-.75)(.26) .75 (6000) cot _a_


= 20,400 + 5570 cot _a_


this is the "average" stress in the stringer.


Substituting into equation (89) for rings,
and using ARG = (1"+3"+1")(.040") = .20 in. [2],


         - 75 (6000) tan _a_
f RG = ~~.20~~ ~~(~~
(15)(.032) + .5 1 - .75)


= 8,300 tan a


_a_ will now be determined, by successive
approximation using equations (94), (86), (90)
and the above expressions for stresses in them,
and also Fig. Cll.36 for equation (94). Since
there is so much compression involved, assume
_a_ = 45 [0 ], to start with. From Fig. Cll.36


EE - 1 83 - 1.83 (6000) = 1036 x 10- [8]
E - 10.6 X 10 [6]
f s -.

Since *:> 2. 0, use 2. (See page Cll. 33)



whence _a_ = 42.6° as against 42.4° assumed. The
accuracy of the theory does not warrant a closer
check, thus _a_ will be taken as 42.4°.


The corresponding stringer and ring stresses
are as follows:


f STR = 20,400 + 5570 (1.092)

= 20,400 + 6090


These are not added for local strength checks.
They are added for a column stability check.
The term on the right is the average stress,

effects.

From the above stresses, fMAX/f ratios,

The same compression stress (and load, P =

the ring is notched to let the stringer pass
through, as is usually done, the net section at
the ring must be made capable of carrying this
load, Which is loca~ed at the centroid of the
un-notched ring cross-section. Usually this
means some "beef-up", locally, around the notched
section; sometimes incorporated into the clip
attaching the stringer to the ring.


Actually the rings, like the stringers, are
subject to the average of the shear stresses in
the panels fore and aft of them. These have
been assumed equal in this example.

FASTENERS


Any fasteners used in this area must, of
course, be able to transfer the load/inch at
the splices as previously calculated. This
criterion might not design the spacing however.
They must also have a tension allowable, when
installed in .032 sk1n, of, equation (98),


Tens.All.Load/Inch = .22 (.032)(62,000)

= 435 lb.


From Fig. Cll.37 it can be seen that 1/8" flush
head aluminum rivets in a dimpled .032 skin at
.50" spacing should be adequate, or 1/8"
brazier head rivets at a spacing of .65" if a
"flush" joint is not required. The tension
requirement is most severe in this case.


GENERAL INSTABILITY


A check against overall instability of the
"network" of rings and stringers can be made
using Fig. Cll.39. This is analagous to the
column stability check for the uprights of a
plane web beam. In the case of curved webs,
however, no "help" is given by the taut skin
in preventing instability.


For this example problem the values used
in calculating the shear stress in the skin at
which "collapse" due to instability would occur

are:


= .414 (Stringer Ss of Fig. A20.4 in
Chapter A20)


P RG = .819


(Both of these radii of gyration are gotten by
including a fUll width of skin acting with the
stringer, w~ = h, and with the ring, we = d,
per Ref. (3).

any instability troubles.



LONGER ON TYPE SYSTEM


Cll.35


The longeron type of structural system is
somewhat simpler from a total analysis standpoint. This is, of course, primarily because
there are fewer members carrying the axial
loads and not as many shear panels With varying
shear loads. This type of structure may, or
may not, be the most optimum arrangement from
a weight and manufacturing cost consideration
for a particular airplane. But this is not the
subject of this discussion since it depends
upon an optimization study. The methods of
analysis presented here WOUld, however, have a
place in the calculations behind such a study.


Some typical types of longeron structural
systems cross-sections for a fuselage are shown
in Fig. Cll.44.

Fig. Cll.44


Fig. (a) shows the minimum arrangemen~, as
to number of longerons, since at least 3 axial
load carrying members are necessary for
equilibrium when bending moments in more than
one plane are involved. This arrangement, however, has a disadvantage in that it is not a
"fail safe" design. This means that the failure
of anyone member will not leave a structure
capable of still carrying some arbitrary
percentage (usually 50% to 67%) of the design
ultimate loads.


The system shown in Fig. Cll.44b is capable
of doing this and is, therefore, the minimum
type acceptable from the "fail safe" standpoint
(410ngerons). More longerons may be used, as
in Fig. (c), occasionally, depending upon other
factors of design and manufacturing.


The longeron system, however, requires
more closely spaced rings than does the stringer


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-819-full.png)

Cll.42 DIAGONAL SEMI-TENSION FIELD DESIGN



system for strength-weight efficiency, as
mentioned before. The optimum spacing of the
supporting rings, or frames, is determined
after many trial calculations flave been made
involving different gauges and sizes and
spacings of rings and thicknesses of skins.


As in the previous discussion of stringer
construction, the rings support the skin,
dividing it into smaller panels, lengthwise.
They also support the longerons, similarly to
the uprights (stiffeners) in a plane web beam,
against bending due to unequal tension field
"pulls" by the skin on each side of the
longeron. There are no "floating" rings in a
longeron structural system.


After buckling, the skin in this system
has tension diagonals which, rather than being
"flat" between closely spaced stringers,
instead lie on a hyperboloid of revolution.
That is, they flatten diagonally between the
closely spaced rings. This action is discussed
in Ref. (8) and the reader should consult it
for the basic theory as presented by Wagner
originally. In this system the ring spacing
"d" is such that d <: h; see Fig. Cl1.34.


Cll.36


The engineering procedure for calculating
stresses and allowables for the longeron system
is somewhat similar to that used for the
stringer system. The reader will note the
differences.


1. First, at any bay being checked, determine
the primary internal load distributions in the
longerons and shear panels due to the applied
loads. This can be done as in Art. Cll.34
using the engineers theory of bendtng in most
cases. In other cases where jUdgment and
experience and the nature of the structure
indicate it, the method of Chapter A8 may be
used in determining the primary load distribution due to the applied loads.


2. Next determine the critical shear buckling
stresses in the skin panels. Since compression
stresses are nearly always also present in
practical situations, pure shear buckling does
not occur. Thus, as discussed in the case for
stringer design, some rational interaction must
be used to obtain a "reduced" shear buckling
stress. This can be done, for example, by
using some "average" compression stress in the
panel, weighted toward the high side for conservatism. Thereby the interaction method of
Article Cll.32 can be used where



and (A) is determined for a curved panel of
length "d" between rings and height (h) between
longerons measured along the circumference as
in Fig. Cll.34. (B) is the ratio of the compression stress to the shear stress, _(fc/f_ _s_ _),_
for the particular loading condition being
investigated. The compression stress should be
calculated as if the panel being calculated had
not yet buckled. Then, as in equation (75)


gives the reduced shear buckling stress, f s cr 

When tension strains, rather than compressive ones, are present with the shear we
have, as in equation (77)


ft
RT = 1.0 +
2F
ccr


and then


f Scr = RT F Scr as in equation (79).


3. Next, the loading ratio, fslf s cr can be
calculated using f s as determined in (2)
above. cr


4. Following this, the diagonal tension
factor, k, can be obtained from Fig. Cll.19.


5. The total axial stress in the longeron can
now be written as


fL = [f ] p [+] [ f] D.T.

and


k, f s, cot Q, Rc (or RT), h, and t are as
previously defined. One set, subscript (1), is
for the panels above the longeron and the other,
(2) for the panel below the longeron.


6. The average stress in the supporting ring
(or frame) due to diagonal tension effects is
given by the following formula (and note that
this is different from the stringer case)


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-820-full.png)

f RG = ARG
__ e + .5 (1   - k)

where, as in equation (58),

ARG =

**Cll.43**


The angle, u, must satisfy the equation,

- - - - - - (105) from Ref. (3), and this is different from the
case 'for stringers,



This formula is similar to the one for the
"effective" area of a single upright in a plane
web beam system, (Art. Cll.20), where


e = distance from c.g. of ring to the skin


p = radius of gyration of the ring (crosssection) about an axis parallel to the
skin.


Equation (105) assumes that k, f s ' d, t,
etc., are the same for the panels on each side
of the ring. If not, then some average value
should be used, or else fRG must be written as
the sum of 2 diagonal tension effects (for each
side panel)--as was done for the longeron in
(5) above.


The "maximum" stress, fRGr1Ax ' in the ring

will be, as before, eq. (59)


fRGmx
fRGmx = fRG (f )
RG


where


is obtained from Fig. Cll.21.


7. The next problem is the determination of
the angle of diagonal tension, u. There are
several ways in which u can be evaluated. Four
are as follows:


tan" u =-------:;---.:::------ e - eL __ (106)

" _co_ _ + 1- _(.Q.)"_ tan" u
eRG 8 R


where, as before, from equation (94)

e = f E [s ] [ sin 2~ u + sin 2 u (l-k) _(l+V)]_


or use Fig. Cll.36 for bracketed expression.


f
L
eL = E (f L from equation (104) )


f
RG
eRG = ~ (fRG from equation (105) )


Equation (106) must be solved by successive
approximation as was done in the stringer system
discussion.


8. Strength checks can then be made as follows,
using stress ratios.


a) Longerons:


f f
-p- +~;;: LO

Foe- FL


where Fcc is the "natural" crippling
strength and FL is obtained from Fig.
Cll.38.


Frequently, in the case of thicker
longerons, the following is used as a
strength check:


f + f
p D.T. < 1.0
Fcc



a)


b)



That is, the primary and diagonal
When there is a significant amount of tension effects are simply added and
compressive strain, simply assume checked against Fcc.
u = 45 [0 ] 
b) Rings:



When there is no, or very little, axial
strain present (only shear) use Fig.
Cll.45 to obtain u.



f
RG ;:;: l.0
F

If the rings have stresses in them due
to loads other than diagonal tension
(i.e. bUlkhead type loads, see Chapter
A21), then an interaction equation is
used.


f p f RG <
--+--= LO
Fcc F
RG



c) If sufficient tension stress (or
strain) is present to prevent buckling,
from eq. (78), then, of course, u = 0 [0 ]   

d) Calculate u by the method of successive
approximation as follows. This is the
most tedious method and (a) and (b)
above will suffice in most cases,
especially for preliminary design.

The properties of the structural crosssection are given in Fig. Cll.48. The
properties shown are for the case where the
bending moment causes the upper skin to be in
compression and the lower in tension. The upper
skin thus buckles out early, as indicated.



1. Using the geometry and properties of Fig.

we find the primary internal stresses to be,

2a. Check top skin panel for f Scr and k.


Use properties of Fig. Cll.47 and the
applied loads to get R c, eq. (74). The skin
compression stresses will be "fictitious" since
the skin buckles out early, but will give the
proper constant, B, for interaction. Assume
fCskin at a point 2/3 up from upper longeron

to top surface as governing compressive
buckling.


         - HZ _ -2,135,000(27.7) = -31 200

Then, from eq. (73),

s


For this upper panel, 5" long (d), 41.8" wide
(h) and R ;:: 30", the critical pure shear and
compression buckling stresses can be found
from buckling equations in Chapter C8.


From Chapter C8, for our panel dimensions,
kc = 10 and ks = 12.83, thus

FS cr = 12 (1 - .3 [2 ] ) 5-

hence, from eq. (72)


FCcr 2310

**CIL** **45**


300 t h _ 300 (.025) (2)*= .5
R d    - 30


k = .81


Next, repeat steps 2a-4a for the side
panels. This involves an arbitrary interaction
to serve as a criterion for buckling under
combined shear and compression.


2b. The stresses at the top (upper longeron)
and bottom (lower longeron) of the side panels
are -37,200 (comp.) and 14,800 (tension)
respectively. This gives an average "fictitious"
stress of -11,200 axial and ± 26,000 psi bending
stress (equivalent). The actual reduced buckling
stress for the side panels could be obtained
from an interaction for these axial and bending
stresses.


Another way is to use an axial stress only,
"weighted" on the high side of the average,
arbitrarily, to account for the effect of the
bending stress. For this problem a compression
stress value half-way between the average,
-11,200, and the maximum, -37,200, is used.


Thus f c = -11,200 ; 37,200 =_ 24,200 psi


then, since f s = 11,780,


B = f [c ] = 24,200 = 2 0.5

6a. The stress in the rings supporting the
upper skin is obtained from eq. (105).


First,


~G .0787
ARG ~~=~~ = = [.0285]
e 1 + (~) P ~~..~~ ~~1~~ + ~~(.75)~~ .58 ..


Then,


.81 (4240) tan _a1._
f RG = .0285 + 5 = [10,600] [ tan] _[ a]_
~~5(~~ ~~.025)~~ ~~.'~~ (1- .81)


As discussed earlier, this assumes the upper
panels on each side of the frame to have the
same shear stress.


6b. The stress in the rings supporting the
side panels is, similarly,


f = .79(11780) tan as = 27,900 tan _a_ _.._
RG .0285 +
5( .025) .5 (1- .79)


_a1._ and _a.._ in the above equations refer to the
upper panels and side panels respectively.


7. Angle of diagonal tension.



f RG -27,900 (.967) =
-.00262
ERG = E = 10.3 x 10 6


then,


e 1.           - E L

e1.            - ERG + "8 (If) tan _a_


.00215 - (-.00507) _
= 1 5    - 1.00
.00215 - (-.00262) +8" (30)S( .705)


Thus, _a_ _.._ = 45 [0] which is close to the 44 [0] assumed.
Let a .. = 45 [0 ] - This bears out the statement that
any significant compression stress (or strain)
forces _a_ towards 45 [0 ] 

Had there been no significant average axial
strain (or stress) present _a_ could be gotten
from Fig. Cll.45 which is based on pure shear
(no axial loads present). Using this for the
above side panels, for example, we would proceed
as follows:


10.3xlO [S] 5
= (30)" = 23.5
11,780


ARdG te = .228 . ~ = .6 = .459
'ht 52.3 (.025)


Then from Fig. Cll.45, using the above parameters,


_a_ = 36 [0] (for no compression)


Thus the effect of compression, as previously
calculated, is significant in forcing _a_ towards
45 [0 ], as frequently assumed for simplicity.


8. Now that _a_ has been established as 45 [0] for
the upper skin panels and for the upper portion
of the side skin panels, the stresses are
available (from (5) and (6) ) and strength
checks can be made.



The compression in the upper panel is so
large that _a1._ can be reasonably taken as 45 [0 ] - a. Longerons:



For the side panel the same is probably
true, in the upper portion, but this will be
checked using the method of successive
approximation and equations (106), (105), (104)
and (94).


Assume _a_ = 44 [0] (and _a_ = 45 [0] ). From
FIg. Cll.36 and equations above,


e = 1.88 (f s ) = 1.88 (lOl.¥:8100S):& .00215
E


fL
eL = E = -.00361- .00028(1.19)   - .00095
(1.19) = -.00507



f p = -37,200; f n. T. = - 29.70(1.0) - 9810(1. 0)

=- 12,780


Fcc = 65,000


Using Fig. Cl1.38, and the formula for "C"
in the figure,


FL = Nx C = 27,700 (1.28) = 35,400


then using the interaction equation
suggested,


37,200 + 12,780 = .935 < 1.0 (adequate)
65,000 35,400


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-824-full.png)

b. Rings:


The ring under the side panel skin will be
most critical (fs is larger):


f RG = 27,900 (1.0) = 27,900


fR~ = 27,900 (1.15) = 30,500 (Using

Fig. Cl1.21)


Then, using Fig. Cll.38,



e.



Cll.47


General Instability


Using Fig. Cll.39, With


P LONG = .554 and P RG = .565


(Using no effective skin, per the figure)


X 10 [4] = 11.35


From Fig. Cll.39



For R = 30" FSINST. = 3.0xExlO- [3] = 30,900 psi


N = 19,200

Thus



F = NxC =
RG

_ FRG
M.S. - f RG



19,200x 1.187 = 22,800


1 = 22,800 30,500 - 1 =- - 25



Thus the ring is not adequate. Either
more area (thickness) is required or a
closer ring spacing (or both) are needed
to lower f RG   

c. Skins:


The side panel has the highest stress and
will be, therefore, more critical from an
ultimate shear strength than the top
panel.


fs = 11,780 psi


From Fig. Cll.42, for k = .79 and FTU =
**72,000,** **Fs** **ALL** **.=** **25,000** **psi.** **M.S.** **=**
(25,000/11,780)    - 1 = 1.13.



d.



Check for Permanent Buckling


Usually there is the requirement that no
permanent skin buckles shall occur at
limit load. This is checked as follows:


f s = ~ = 11,780 = 7,840 psi
limit 1.5 1.5


Using Fig. Cll.46



4 F scr x 10 8 = 4 (2! 980) x 10 8 =
Ec x Fcy 10.3 X _lOB_ x 62,000



1.87

Scr  


30,900
M.S. 1 = 1.62
11,780
(large)


f. Rivets


The rivet requirements can be checked in
the same manner as was done for the stringer
type structure along any skin splices and
for the tension field "prying" forces.


The load transferred between the longeron
and the ring can be calculated as


P RG = f RG x ARG e ' from (8b) and (6a)

= 27,900 x .0285

= 795 lb.


This load is actually carried by the rivets
attaching the outer ring flange to the
longeron flange (next to the Skin) and also
by the gusset action of the skin at the
ring-longeron junction. Two fasteners,.
staggered if necessary, should be used to
attach the outer ring flange to the longeron
flange. (See discussion of joggles in
Chapter D3).


Cll.38 Summary.


From these examples involving both stringer
and longeron type construction it can be seen
that the effect of axial compression stresses
(or strains) alon~with the shear stresses in
the panels is two-fold:


a) It brings about, through interaction,
earlier buckling of the panels than
would result from shear stresses alone.
The result is, of course, a higher
value of k and, hence, of all the ensuing loads and stresses that are a
function of k.

Cll.48 DIAGONAL SEMI-TENSION FIELD DESIGN



b) The angle of diagonal tension is
forced to approach 45 [0 ], more than
would result from shear stresses only.



1. In the example problem of Art. Cll.34,
what M.S. would exist if the ring were
made of .032 2024 (instead of .040).
(Assume _a_ = 45 [0] ).



Cll.39 Problems for Part 2.



The effect of tension stresses is just the
opposite and can thus be conservatively·
ignored, or evaluated if desired.
2.

From a time-saving standpoint, in preliminary design, an arbitrarily large value of
k and an angle of diagonal tension of 45 [0] can
be assumed where significant axial compression
strains are present. 3.


The exact magnitude of the various diagonal
tension effects throughout a network of skin
panels defies simple evaluation from an
analytical standpoint. This is particularly 4.
true when both shear stresses and axial
stresses change from panel to panel as in most
practical structures and loadings. No simple
analytic expressions are available. But some
rational approach is necessary to complete the
design, or specimens for test programs, and the
approaches given in this chapter represent one
such procedure. If margins are extremely
small, element tests for substantion are in
order. The reader is encouraged to consult
the references for a more thorough understanding 5.
of the basic theory and its limitations,
particularly with regards to areas where sUbstantiating test data is relatively meager.



In the example problem of Art. Cll.34, how
wide could the ring spacing, d, be made
and still show a positive M.S. for the
ring. (Assume u = 45 [0] .)


In the example problem of Art. Cll.34, how
much additional torsion, T, could be
applied before the ring would show a
M.S. = O. (Assume _a_ = 45 [0] .)


Repeat example problem Art. Cll.34 using
applied loads


M = 2,600,000 in./lb.
T = 0
V **=** **40,000** **lb.**


Assume the general section properties (I
and neutral axis location) remain the same
as in Cll.34.


In the example problem of Art. Cll.37


a) What (standard) gauge of 7075-T6 sheet
aluminum would the ring have to be to
show a minimum positive M.S.


b) What ring spacing, d, would be required
for the .032" ring to show a minimum
positive M.S. (M.S. "'=' 0)



The stringer sys~em is usually found, for
example, in fuselage structures where there
are relatively few large "cut-outs" to disrupt
the stringer continuity. This is more typical
of transport, bomber and other cargo carrying
aircraft. The longeron type structure is more
efficient and sUitable where a large number
"quick-access" panels and doors and other
"cut-outs" are necessary to service various
systems rapidly. These would "chop-up" a
stringer system rather severely, making it
quite expensive from both a weight and manufacturing standpoint. Therefore, longeron
systems are more usually found in fighter and
attack type aircraft, and in others with unusual features. There are also, of course,
other factors influencing the choice of
structural arrangement.


Some further notes concerning this general
subject are included in Chapter D3. This
includes ""beef-up" of panels and axial members
bordering cut-outs or non-structural doors,
which is also related to "end-bay" effects
discussed in Cll.29.


- It is not conservative to ignore the reducing effect of tension
stresses on k if the compression stresses due to diagonal
tension are being relied upon to reduce any primary load
tension stresses in stringers or longerons.



6. Repeat the example problem of Art. Cll.37
using as applied loads.


M = 2,400,000 in./lb.
T = 0
V = 28,000 lb.


(Assume section properties are not changed.)


7. What is required to eliminate any negative
margins of safety in Problem (6).


Cll.40 Problems for Part 1.


(1) The beam as shown in Fig. (A) is subjected to a shear load of 8000 lb. as shown.
Determine the margin of safety for the given
loading for the following units: (1) web,
(2) web flange rivets, (3) web stiffeners. Use
NACA method.


(2) Same as problem (1) but with web upright spacing = 4".


(3) Design a semi-tension field beam for
the beams and loading of Fig. (B). Take web
as 2024-T3 with minimum thickness being .020.

**CHAPTER** C12

**SANDWICH CONSTRUCTION** **AND** **DESIGN**


BY


LLOYD E. HACKMAN· SR. TECHNICAL SPECIALIST, N. AMERICAN AVIATION, COLUMBUS, OHIO



C12.1 Introduction.


In the past decade sandwich construction
has been developed until it is now a Widely
accepted type of construction in the aircraft
industry. This acceptance is due to the
continuous development of the sandwich components, sandwich design and fabrication, and the
confidence gained through the years in which
the sandwich concept has been applied.


The components of sandwich construction
are facings, cores and core-to-facing bonding
materials. A sandwich panel is analogous to
an I-beam with the facings and core corresponding to the flanges and web, respectively.
The facings carry axial tensile and compressive
stresses and the core sustains shear and
compressive stresses normal to the panel and
prevents wrinkling or buckling of the facings
under axial compressive loading. The continuous
support of the facings provided by the core
material is also important to aerodynamic
performance in aircraft applications. The coreto-facing bond must be adequate to transfer the
stresses from facings to core so that the full
properties of the core and facings may be
realized.


Materials commonly used as facings include
metal sheet such as aluminum, titanium, stainless steel, or reinforced plastic laminate.
Adhesives used for core-to-facing bonding are
normally of the liquid and supported film types.
Reinforced plastic laminate facings may be
attached to certain cores by a "wet layup"
technique which is accomplished by allowing the
uncured impregnating resin to act as the bonding
agent. This method generally provides bonds of
lower strength than when an adhesive is used.


Although a discussion of sandwich adhesive
development is not a part of this sec~ion, it is
to be noted that the core-to-facing bonding
materials are extremely important. Like a
chain, a sandwich is no better than its weakest
link - the facing, core, or core-to-facing bond.


Core materials for sandwich construction
may be divided into two classes - metallic and
non-metallic. The metallic cores inclUde
aluminum, titanium and stainless steel honeycomb and are employed where high shear strength,
shear modulus and, in the case of stainless
steel, where high temperature resistance is
required. In the lower temperature ranges,



aluminum honeycomb is generally preferred because of its relatively low cost. Stainless
steel honeycomb may be adhesive-bonded or brazed
to facings. The brazing technique is relatively
expensive and difficult, and is used only when
necessary, which is in the temperature range
from about 500 degrees F upward, where adhesivebonded sandwich is not, at present, adequate for
extended periods of time.


Foams, balsa, and reinforced plastic honeycombs comprise the non-metallic core materials.
The foams possess a wide range of properties but
it may be generally said that they have relatively low strength in comparison with the other
core materials. However, the thermal insulation
properties of the foams, and the ability of
certain foams to be "foamed in place", thus
conforming to any contour, make them an attractive core material in certain applications. The
high strength properties of honeycomb and thermal
insulation of low density foams can be advantageously combined to provide a high-strength
insulating core material.


Within the family of metallic cores of
which there are many different core types,
honeycomb has emerged as the best known. However, the corrugated or truss core sandwich is
of equal importance in the design of high performance aircraft. The corrugated core sandwich construction will be discussed in section
C12.9 in greater detail.


The design procedures of this section are
based principally on analyses and tests performed
by the U. S. Forest Products Laboratory under the
sponsorship of the CompOSite Construction Subcommittee (formerly ANC-23 Panel) of the Federal
Aircraft Design Criteria Committee.


C12.2 Basic Design Principles.


structural sandwich is a layered construction formed by bonding two thin facings to a
thick core. It is a type of stressed-skin construction in Which the facings resist all, or
nearly all, of the applied edgewise loads and
flatwise bending moments. The thin spaced
facings provide all, or nearly all, of the
bending rigidity to the construction. The core
spaces the facings and transmits shear between
them so that they are effective about a common
neutral axis. The core also provides most of the
shear rigidity of the sandwich construction. By
proper choice of materials for facings and core,



C12.1

C12.2 SANDWIC H CONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN



constructions with high ratios of stiffness to
weight can be achieved.


A basic design concept is to space strong,
thin facings far enough apart to achieve a high

r~~io of stiffness to weight; the lightweight
core that does this must provide the required
resistance to shear and be strong enough to
stabilize the facings to their desired configuration through a bonding medium such as an
adhesive layer, braze, or weld.


In order that sandwich cores be lightweight, they are usually made of a low-density
material, of some type of cellular construction
(honeycomb-like core formed of thin sheet
material), or of corrugated sheet material.
As a consequence of employing a lightweight
core, design methods must account for core
shear deformation because of the low effective
shear modulus of the core. The main difference
in design procedures for sandwich structural
elements as compared to design procedures for
homogeneous material is the inclusion of the
effects of core shear properties on deflection,
buckling, and stress.


Because thin facings can be used to carry
loads in sandwich, consideration must be given
to the prevention of local failure under edgewise direct or flatwise bending loads just as
local crippling of stringers must be considered
in the design of sheet-stringer construction.
Modes of failure that may occur in sandwich
under edge load are shown in Fig. C12.2.1.


Shear crimpling failure (Fig. C12.2.1B)
appears to be a local mode of failure, but is
often a form of general overall buckling
(Fig. C12.2.lA) in which the wavelength of the
buckles becomes very small because of low core
shear modulus. The crimping of the sandwich
occurs very suddenly and usually causes the
core to fail in shear at the crimp; it may also
cause shear failure in the bond between the
facing and core. Crimping may also occur in
conjunction with overall buckling of the
sandwich. In such cases, the overall buckle
begins to appear and the crimp occurs suddenly
because of severe local shear stresses at the
ends of the overall buckle. As soon as the
crimp appears, the overall buckle may disappear.


Therefore, although examination of the
failed sandwich indicates crimping or shear
instability, failure may have begun by overall
buckling that finally caused crimping.


If the core is of cellular (honeycomb) or
corrugated material, it is possible for the
facings to buckle or dimple into the spaces
between core walls or corrugations as shown in
Fig.C12.2.1C. This dimpling of the facings may
not lead to failure unless the amplitude of the
dimples is large enough to cause the dimples to



Fig. C12. 2. 1 Possible modes of failure of sandwich construction under edgewise loads: General buckling, shear
crimping, dimpling of facings, and wrinkling of facings
either away from or into the core.


grow across the core cell walls and result in a
wrinkling of the facings. Dimpling that does
not cause total structural failure may, of
course, be severe enough so that permanent
dimples remain after removal of load.


Wrinkling, as shown in Fig. C12.2.1D, may
occur if a sandwich facing subjected to edgeWise
compression buckles as a plate on an elastic
foundation. The facing may buckle inward or
outward, depending on the flatwise compressive
strength of the core relative to the flatwise
tensile strength of the bond between the facing
and core. If the bond between facing and core
is strong, facings can wrinkle and cause tension
failure in the core. Thus, the wrinkling load
depends upon the elasticity and strength of the
foundation system; namely, the core and the bond
between facing and core. Since the facing is
never perfectly flat, the wrinkling load will
also depend upon the initial facing eccentricity
or original waviness.


The local modes of failure may occur in
sandwich panels under edgewise loads and/or
under normal loads. In addition to overall
buckling and local modes of failure, sandwich
shall be designed so that facings do not fail
in tension, compression, shear, or combined
stresses due to edgewise loads and/or normal
loads, and cores do not fail in shear or flatwise compression due to normal loads.

The basic design principles can be summarized into four required conditions as follows:


1. Sandwich facings shall be at least
thick enough to withstand chosen design
stresses under design~ loads.


2. The core shall be thick enough and
have sufficient shear rigidity and strength so
that overall sandwich buckling, excessive
deflection, or shear failure will not occur
under design~ loads.


3. The core shall have high enough moduli
of elasticity, and the sandwich shall have
great enough flatwise tensile and compressive
strength so that wrinkling of either facing
will not occur under design~ loads.


4. If the core is cellular (honeycomb)
or of corrugated material and dimpling of the
facing is not permissible, the cell size or
corrugation spacing shall be small enough so
that dimpling of either facing into the core
spaces will not occur under design~ loads.


In the choice of materials and methods of
sandwich assembly, consideration must be given
to the environment in which the sandwich is
to perform, and material properties used for
design should be compatible with the expected
environment. Included as environment are
effects of heat, cold, water or moisture,
corrosive atmosphere or fluids, fatigue, creep,
or any other conditions that may affect
material properties. Design details should be
such as to prevent difficulties insofar as
possible in regard to proper performance.


Certain nonstructural characteristics,
such as thermal conductivity, resistance to
surface abrasion, dimensional stability,
permeability, and electrical properties of the
sandwich materials should be considered in
arriving at a thoroughly efficient design for
the intended purpose.


Detailed procedures giving formulas and
graphs for use in structural design are given
in the following sections of C12. The formulas
and graphs can be used to determine dimensions
of facings and core as well as necessary core
properties for sandwich components under
various types of loading. Graphs and formulas
are presented in terms of general parameters,
and are not for specific materials. Design
criteria involving buckling are based on
theoretical buckling coefficients. These


~ Design load shall be not less than "design ultimate load"
when composite structures are to be designed for use in
military aircraft where the requirements of military
specifications series MIL-A-8860 (ASG) through
MIL-A-8870 (ASG) must be met.



C12.3


coefficients have been in fair agreement with
average test reSUlts, but allowance can be made
in the final design to account for the scatter
characteristic of buckling test results, perhaps
by choosing a slightly thicker core, so that
buckling of the sandwich component does not
occur at design~ load.


C12.3 Nomenclature.


The following nomenclature is used in this
chapter. Each section devoted to a particular
sandwich component will define the symbolS used
the first time in that section. Sketches in

This formula assumes that the total crosssection of the cell walls deflects uniformly
due to axial stress. In actual practice,
however, the cell walls between nodes buckle
at a relatively low stress level and the nodes
are then required to operate at a higher stress
levei than indicated by a uniform stress
distribution. Therefore, core compression
modulus values indicated by tests are considerably lower than the theoretical values.


BONDED HEXAGONAL CELL CORE


In the case of Young's Modulus, the
theoretical equation remains the same in the
case of hexagonal cell core. Therefore it is
suggested that equation C12.4.12 and C12.4.13
be used to represent the design curves.

C12. 4. 9 Other Isotropic Cores


Although honeycomb cores find the greatest
use in the aircraft industry along with the
corrugated core concept, other core materials
find many uses. The more important materials
used as cores are thoughs of Balsa wood and
foamed plastics. Core properties such as
density, tension, compression, and shear
allowables, compression and shear moduluses,
can be found in producers handbooks. These
core materials can be handled much the same
as honeycomb but in general with less efficienc
and less cost.


C12. 5 Honeycomb Flat Panel Failure Modes.


C12. 5. 1 General.


Honeycomb sandwich is sUbject to three
forms of local instability. They are
(1) intracell buckling, (2) face sheet
wrinkling and (3) shear crimping. (Ref.
Section C12.8)


In general, intracell buckling will be
critical for elements with thin face sheets;
wrinkling will be critical for light density
cores; and shear crimping will be critical for
light density cores in combination with high
Kt, _(tFlc),_ values.


C12. 5.2 Intracell Buckling.


C12. 5.2. 1 Compression (Ref. 1, 2).


Intracell buckling is a local instability
failure of the faces. If the face thickness
is reduced while the cell size and material are
held constant, a certain thickness will be
reached at which the face will fail between
the cell walls. A typical intracell buckling
failure is shown on Fig. C12.5.1.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-839-2.png)


Fig. C12. 5. 1


The empirical intracell buckling equations
in the following sections were developed from
tests. Although the probability of meeting or
exceeding these allowables is not known, the
chosen allowables will be met by almost all
future sandwich tests.


The intracell buckling stress varies
principally as a function of face thickness
and cell size. Core density, core depth and
node flow condition do not directly affect the



intracell buckling stress. The effect of
transverse ribbon direction is negligible.


The design curve for intracell buckling
failure under a uniaxial compression load in
the direction of the ribbon can be expressed by
the equation:

C12. 5.4 Shear Crimping.


Shear crimping failure is a form of general
instability failure where the wave length of
the buckle becomes very small due to low core
shear modulus. This failure occurs swidenly
and causes the core to fail in shear at the
crimp.

C12. 5.6 General Shear Buckling Allowables.


This section presents the general shear

Given the geometry, material properties, and
edge fixity for a particular panel, the shear
buckling allowable can be found from the above
equations and the curves g;iven in this section.
The K s values for clamped, and simply supported
edges are given on Figs. C12,5.l5 and C12.5.l6,
respectively. The simple support allowables
are based on equations given in Ref. 4, and the
clamped edge allowables are taken from Ref. 5.

Curved panels constructed of honeycomb
sandwich can fail either by general instability
of the total panel or by local instability of
the face sheets. This section considers the
former failure while the local instability
failure considered for flat panels can be used
for curved panels. Loads that affect the
general instability of a panel are axial compression in either direction (N x or Ny),
in-plane shear (qs) and in-plane bending
moments (M bx and M by )'

C12. 7 Buckling of Flat Panels with Dissimilar Faces.


C12. 7. 1 General.


The capability to handle the buckling of
panels with unequal facings or facings of dissimilar materials is particularly important
in a refined aircraft design. The need for
such a method is made necessary quite often by
the requirements of minimum external gauges to
prevent damage during ground servicing and
handling. In recent years with the advent of
thermal stresses, the requirement for design
with different gauge faces or even different
facing materials has become important. Even
though a design at room temperature may be
considered as similar facing materials, because
of the material property effects at temperature, the fac.1ngs must be considered dissimilar
for a more exact analysis.


The buckling of a sandwich panel with
facings of unequal thickness or dissimilar
materials was treatect in Ref. 8. The
equations presented in this section will deal
only with dissimilar isotropic facings. The
referenced report deals further with dissimilar
orthotropic facings and similar isotropic
facings, all with unequal gauges. All the
equations consider orthotropic core material.


C12. 7. 2 Uniaxial Compression.


The design of a honeycomb panel with unequal or dissimilar faces must still consider
the local failure modes discussed in sections
C12.5.2, C12.5.3, and C12.5.4. The general
buckling allowable equation presented here is
in terms of load. The equation is a function
of two unequal isotropic facing thicknesses
with different material properties, core depth,
core density, edge fixity, and panel size.
This equation can be written as follows:

C12. 8. 1 General.


In the use of structural sandwich construction, particularly for aircraft structures,
it is often necessary to carry loads into the
sandwich through fittings that allow loads to
be applied in a direction normal or inclined to
the plane of the sandwich. The fittings are
usually fastened to the sandwich by attachment
to a small insert that locally replaces the
sandwich core. This insert may be of metal or
of denser core, and it is bonded between the
facings at the time the sandwich is manufactured.


The theoretical and experimental work
performed in Ref. 9 was conducted on relatively
large circular sandwich panels that had a
small, circular insert at their center. Loads
were applied at the insert in a direction
normal to the sandwich panel. In order to
measure core strains the work was limited to
conttnuous core materials, one of end grain
balsa wood representing a core of moderate shear
modulus and one of cork board representing a
core of low shear modulus.


Since the results of this work was limited
to an insert in the center of a panel and to
isotropic core materials, in the final design
chse, corrections to this data must be made to
account for.orthotropic cores and non-centrally
located inserts. The correction in the case
of orthotropic cores can be made in proportion
to the directional shear modulus Gx and G y • The
correction for the case of non-centrally located
inserts can be made on the basis of beam shears
to their end supports, or inversely proportional
to the distance of the load from the supports.


C12. 8. 2 Shear Stress Distribution .



K = 1 + 2 x 1 + 1 = 4



The shear stresses are a maximum at or near

Of the wide variety of sandwich constructions available, two important types are
those with isotropic cores and those with corrugated cores. Basic theories for the stability
analysis of sandwich plates with isotropic
facing sheets have been published in the
technical literature. Extensive application of
these theories has been given to isotropic or
nearly isotropic core sandwich under combined
in-plane loads. Of the highly orthotropic
cores, the corrugated core has important practical use and is the type considered in the paper
of Ref. 10 and presented in this section.


Whereas the treatment of isotropic panels
under various edgewise loads has been extensive,
a similar treatment for corrugated core sandwich has been somewhat limited. This section
presents solutions to these cases of corrugated
core sandwich SUbjected to in-plane, combined
longitudinal compression and bending, transverse compression and bending, and shear using
a variation of the theory formalized in Ref. 11.


The basic elenent of the idealized corrugated core sandwich panel (Shown in Fig.
C12.9.1) considered in this paper, consists of
relatively thin isotropic facings, which have
negligible flexural rigidities about their own
centroidal axes, and a highly orthotropic core
for which shear distortions are assumed to be
admissible only in the plane perpendicular to
the corrugations. Furthermore, the bending
rigidity of the core is assumed to be negligible
in the transverse direction. In general, for
the corrugated core, the core shear modulus is
many times greater in the plane along the
corrugations (longitudinal) than it is perpendicular to the corrugations (transverse) and
the above assumption regarding the shear
distortions appears to be realistic for many
such configurations. Both the facings and the
core are assumed to be elastic.


Beside the general buckling allowables
developed in this section for the corrugated
sandwich panel, local instability must also be
considered. The local buckling of the corrugated sandwich panel elements can be handled
through the use of standard isotropic panel


buckling equation F cR :: KE (;)" using K for the

respective t~~e element and element loading.

buckling coefficient appears small over the
wide range of the J parameter.


The effect of variations in Poisson's ratio,

~, on compression and shear buckling coefficients
was investigated for values of J of 5.0 and 0.5.
The effect decreases for increasing values of J
and the buckling coefficients corresponding to
a J of infinity are independent of Poisson's
ratio.


The effect of the core direction on the
buckling coefficient was investigated for compression and shear. For compression, the
buckling coefficient is greater if the corrugations are parallel to the applied load. In
addition, the core area reduces the applied
compressive stress for a given load per inch
if the corrugations are parallel to the applied
load. For shear, the buckling coefficient is
greater if the corrugations are oriented in the
short direction. These conclusions are consistent with the behavior of stiffened plate.


Seide (Ref. 12) has presented curves for
the buckling coefficients of simply supported,
corrugated core sandwich under longitUdinal
compression with the core longitudinal. A
comparison which was made between the results
presented graphically by Seide and those presented in this section showed good agreement
exists between the results obtained by the two
analyses.


Buckling coefficient curves are presented
for a number of important loading conditions.
For many practical sandwich configurations, the
effect on the buckling coefficients of Poisson's
ratio and of the core longitudinal bending
rigidity appears to be relatively small compared
to the effect of the core shear rigidity.


In addition to overall instability, sandwich plates must be analyzed for local modes of
failure which have not been considered in the
presented curves.

Coeffic ients.


The Rayleigh-Ritz energy method was used
to formulate the stability criterion. The
buckled shape is assumed in the form of a
double sine series which is substituted into
energy equation. Minimization of the resulting

e~pression with respect to the coefficients of
the assumed series and the ratio of the bending
and tWisting deflection to the total defJection
yields a system of linear homogeneous equations
from which the buckling coefficients are
evaluated by a matrix iteration .procedure.


Curves of the buckling coefficients are
plotted in Figs. C12.9.2 through C12.9.10. The
validity of the present results is restricted
to those cases for which the bending rigidities
of the facings about their individual axes is
negligible. In general, the bending rigidity

magnitude of this problem exceeds acceptable
design time if the designer is required to
start each panel design from allowable equations.
With as many as five (5) parameters (tF~' t F ",
h, t c/ s, S) to describe the cross-section of a
honeycomb panel, two (2) parameters (b, a/b) to
describe the panel configuration, and six (6)
parameters, (p x, Py, Q, V, Mx, My) to describe
the panel loading, it can be seen that the
problem of honeycomb design optimization can
become laborious.


This section will demonstrate the use of
the allowable equations presented in Section
C12.4 through C12.9 for the design of sandwich
structures. With reference to Section C12.2
and Fig. C12.2.1, each of the allowable
equations for the primary failure modes must
be considered for the simplest honeycomb panel
design. For efficient design of sandwich
structures, a general rule can be established
that the critical stress for each failure mode
should be equal to the ultimate applied stress.
Compliance with this rule alone, however, does
not insure the most efficient sandwich structure.
In many structures the higher the allowable
stress level the more efficient the structure.
This is not necessarily true for a sandwich
structure. It must be remembered that for the
higher stress level in the sandwich facings the
more core material that is required. If a true
optimization is performed it can show that the
optimum stress level is a function of the
applied load level. In this section, data is
also presented which will eliminate requirements for the designer to manipulate the large
number of parameters through the many possible
allowable equations. The data indicates to the
designer the most efficient panel for the given
conditions. The method used to arrive at such
general data, is to write a weight equation in
terms of the respective allowables. This weight
equation is then minimized by one of several
methods to produce a minimum weight as a
function of the variable parameters. The
digital computer must be used to compute the
optimum panel configurations from the derived
minimum weight equations in most cases. The
data produced with this iterative process
presents the data in a form from which an
optimum design may be selected directly.

C12.10 Design of Sandwich Structures. C12. 10.2 Dimpling of Sandwich Facings.



C12. 10. I General.


With increased performance requirements in
present day aircraft minimum weight design is
being stressed more and more. The present
state-of-the-art dictates the use of honeycomb
type structure in many areas to achieve a
minimum weight design. Great care must be used
in the design of a honeycomb panel to take
advantage of the possible efficiencies. The



If the core of a sandwich construction is
of cellular (honeycomb) or corrugated material,
it is possible for the facings to buckle or
dimple into the spaces between core walls.
Dimpling of the facings may not lead to failure
unless the amplitude of the dimples becomes
large and causes the dimples or buckles to grow
across core cell walls and result in wrinkling
of the facings. Dimpling that does not cause
total structural failure may, of course, be

C12.34 SANDWICH CONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN



severe enough so that permanent dimples remain
after removal of load.


If dimpling of the facings is not
permissible, the core cell size shall be small
enough so that dimpling will not occur under
design loads. The design procedures assume
that a facing thickness (t) is known (facing
thickness having been determined by consideration of design loads and chosen design
compressive facing stresses), that facing
compressive stress Fc and effective compressive
modulus of elasticity EF are known, and that
the core cell size is to be determined. The
facing properties shall be values at the
condition of use; that is, if application is at
elevated temperature, then facing properties at
elevated temperature shall be used in design.
The facing modulus of elasticity is the
effective value at the facing stress. If this
stress is beyond the proportional limit value,
an appropriate tangent, reduced, or modified
compression modulus of elasticity shall be
used.


Sandwich with Cellular (Honeycomb) Core


This section gives the procedure for
determining the core cell size such that a
sandwich facing will not dimple.


The facing stress at which dimpling of the
sandwich facing will occur is given by the
empirical formula C12.5.l.


F c = 0.75 EF _(tF/s)3/2_


where EF is effective compressive modulus of

elasticity of the facing EF~ at stress Fc; t F
is facing thickness, and s is core cell size
(diameter of inscribed circle). Solving
formula C12.5.l for s reSUlts in


Maximum core cell size can be determined
from formula C12.l0.l. If the core cell size
is smaller than available, it is necessary to
use a thicker facing and a lower stress in
order that dimpling will occur at the same
edge load. The equation C12.l0.l can also be
used to find facing thicknesses and stresses
for dimpling of sandwich facings on cores of
a particular cell size.


A similar derivation can be made for face
dimpling for the panel in shear. The following
equation reSUlts:


              - - - - - -(C12.l0.2)



The face wrinkling mode of failure
described in Section C12.2 cannot be allowed to
occur to any extent in a sandwich panel. Thus
the design procedure presented here will preclude any such failure at the design load. The
design procedures assume that the facing compressive stress Fc and the effective compressive
modulus E F are known, and that the core density
parameter _tcls_ is to be determined. The facing
properties shall be values at the condition used.


This section gives the procedure for determining the core density parameter _tcls_ such
that the sandwich facing will not wrinkle (or
separate away from the core). The facing stress
at which wrinkling of the sandwich facing will
occur is given by the empirical equation
C12.5.l0


Fc = .43 0/ E F ~~E~~~ ~~G~~~



Sandwich Having Corrugated Core


This section gives the procedure for
determining the spacing between core corrugations such that sandwich facing or core elements
will not buckle (Ref. 13). For edge compression
load in a direction parallel to the core aXiS,
the design procedure is based on the buckling
load of the unsupported facing or core element,
whichever is the lower, although it may be
possible to utilize a sandwich in which the
core elements are buckled. For edge compression
load in a direction perpendicular to the core
aXiS, the design procedure is based on the
buckling load of the unsupported facing ele~ent
and the core is assumed to be rigid enough to
cause rotational restraint at the ends of the
facing element. If the core is double corrugated, it may not have sufficient strength to
cause the facing elements to buckle as assumed.


The facing stress at which buckling of the
facing element or core elffinent will occur is
given by the formula


Fc = K E' (~F)2 - - - - - - - - - -(C12.l0.3)
c
where E' is the effective compressive modulus
of elasticity of the facing E~ at stress Fc ;
tF is facing thickness; bc is unsupported Width
of facing element; and K is a coefficient
dependent upon the ratio _(tc/tF)_ of the corrugation thickness (t c ) to the facing thickness
(tF), the angle (9) between the corrugation
element and the facing, and the type of applied
load.

This section presents a procedure for
determining the core depth such that the
sandwich panel will not fail in general instability buckling. The facing stress at
which general buckling of the sandwich panel
will occur is given by the equation C12.5.19.

The minimum core density can be determined
from equation C12.10.6. If the core density
required is lower than that available, a
lower density can be used or the facing
stress increased. If the core density is
greater than can be obtained, the facing stress
should be reduced. This same equation holds
for design for in-plane shear loads.


_C12._ 10.4 Shear Crimping of Sandwich Panels.


The shear crimping mode of failure
described in Section C12.2 is not considered
one of the primary failure modes but must be
checked for any sandwich design. The shear
crimping allowable equation can be used
primarily to determine the core depth c when
the core density _tc/s_ is known. The equation
can also be used to determine _tcls_ when the
core depth c is known. It is assumed in both
cases that the facing thickness tF and facing
stress Fc are known.


This section gives the procedure for
determining the core depth and density
parameter _tcls_ such that the sandwich panel
will not fail in shear crimping. The facing
stress at which shear crimping of the sandwich
panel will occur is given by equation C12.5.18.

C12.36 SANDWICH CONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN



If the core depth should be greater than
is practical or greater than volume requirements will allow, the stress level Fc or the
panel size b must be changed. For a case where
the structural sandwich panels are being used
as insulation of fuel cells or equipment bays,
if the core depth c can be made greater the
panel size b should be increased to reduce the
back up structure required.


A similar derivation can be made for other
loading cases and results only in the change
of K c to that for the respective load
condition.


C12. 10. 5 Design of Flat Sandwich Panels.


Assuming that a design begins with a given
load to transmit and chosen design stresses, a
flat rectangular panel of sandwich construction
under edgewise compression load shall be
designed to comply with the following four
conditions:


~ (1) The facings shall be at least thick
enough to withstand the chosen design compressive stresses.


(2) The core shall be thick enough and
have a shear modulus high enough so that overall buckling of the sandwich panel will not

oc~ur under the design compression load.


(3) The core shall have high enough
moduli of elasticity, and the sandwich shall
have great enough flatwise tensile and compressive strength, so that wrinkling of either
facing will not occur. (Design procedure given
in Section C12.10.3.)


(4) If the core is of honeycomb type and
dimpling of the facing 1s not permissible, the
cell size shall be small enough so that dimpling
of either facing into the core cells will not
occur. (Design procedure given in Section
C12.10.2. )


These four conditions must be met. Overall buckling of the sandwich or dimpling or
wrinkling of the facings cannot occur without
possible total collapse of the panel. Detailed
procedures giving theoretical formulas are
presented in this section.


C12. 10. 5. 1 Determining Facing Thicknesses and Panel
Parameters.

For honeycomb panels in compression:


tF 4 F C4 + tFs F Cs = N (for unequal facings)

               - - - - (C12.10.12)


t F = 2~ (for equal facings) (C12.10.13)
c



where tF is facing thickness; Fc is chosen
design facing compressive stress; N is design
compression load per inch of panel edge; and

4, 2 are subscripts denoting facings 1 and 2.


In determining thicknesses of facings for
sandwich with facings of different materials,
equation C12.10.12 must be satisfied, but also
the stresses Fc 4 and Fc s must be chosen so that
F C1 /E s4 = Fcs/E ss (where Es is facing secant
modulus of elasticity), thus avoiding overstressing of either facing. For example, if
facing 1 is a material such that the ratio
F Cy4 /Es 1 = 0.005 and facing 2 is a material such
that the ratio Fcys/ESs = 0.002, the design must
be based on a strain of 0.002, otherwise facing
2 will be overstressed. In order to accomplish
this, the chosen design stress for facing 1
must be lowered.


This section also gives procedures for
determining core thickness and core shear
modulus so that overall buckling of the sandwich panel will not occur. The facing stress
at which buckling of a sandwich panel with
isotropic facings will occur is given by the
theoretical formula C12.5.19 from which the
primary relation for core depth c was derived
as equation C12.10.10.

In determining the thickness of facings

equation C12.10.14 must be satisfied, but also
the stresses FsJ. and F ss must be chosen so that
F S1 /G S J. = FSs/G Ss (where Gs is facing shear

Assuming that a design begins With a given

cylinder with walls of sandwich construction

to comply with the following five conditions:


(1) The facings shall be at least thick
enough to withstand the chosen design compressive stresses.


(2) The core shall be thick enough and
have a shear modulus high enough so that
buckling of the sandwich cylinder walls will
not occur under the design compression load.


(3) The core shall have high enough moduli
of elasticity, and the sandwich shall have great
enough flatwise tensile and compressive strength
so that wrinkling of either facing will not
occur. (DeSign procedure given in Section
C12.1O.3. )

C12.38 SANDWICH CONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN



(5) The entire cylinder shall have
sufficient bending stiffness so that buckling
as a long column will not occur.



These five conditions must be met. Buckling of the cylinder or the sandwich walls, or
dimpling or wrinkling of the facings, cannot
occur without possible total collapse of the
cylinder. Detailed procedures giving theoretical formulas and graphs for determining
dimensions of the facings and core, as well as
necessary core properties, are given in the
following paragraphs. Double formulas are
given, one formula for sandwich with facings of
different materials and thicknesses and another
formula for sandwich with each facing of the
same material and thickness. Facing modulus
of elasticity, Er, and stress values, Fc ' shall
be compression values at the condition of use,
that is, if application is at elevated temperature; then facing properties at elevated
temperature shall be used in design. The
facing modulus of elasticity is the effective
value at the facing stress. If this stress'is
beyond the proportional limit value, an appropriate tangent, reduced, or modified compression modulus of elasticity shall be used.



modulus so that overall buckling of the sandwich walls of the cylinder will not occur. The
procedures are applicable to cylinders longer
than the length of one ideal buckle such as
would form in the wall of a long cylinder.
Generally, the ideal buckle length is about
equal to the radius of the cylinder if the core
shear modulus is high. It becomes shorter than
the radius as the core shear modulus decreases.
For cylinders shorter than the ideal buckle
length the load at which buckling of the wall
occurs will be higher than given here.


The facing stress at which buckling of the
sandwich wall will occur is given by the
theoretical formula C12.6.5.


The core shear modulus can be determined
by the local failure criteria discussed in
Section Cl2.10.3 by deriving the relationship
of core density _tc/s_ given by equation C12.10.6.

In determining thicknesses of facings of
different materials, equation C12.10.21 must
be satisfied, but also the stresses Fc~ and F C2
must be chosen so that Fc~/Es~ = _FC2/Es2_
(where Es is facing secant modulus of
elasticity), thus avoiding overstressing of
either facing. For example, if facing 1 is a
material such that the ratio Fc~/Es~ = 0.005
and facing 2 is a material such that the ratio
F C2 /E s2 = 0.002, the design must be based on a
ratio of 0.002, otherwise facing 2 will be
overstressed. In order to accomplish this,
the chosen design stress for facing 1 must be
lowered.


If the cylinder is long and slender and
the radius is limited, the facing thicknesses
may have to be increased in order to prevent
column buckling.

determining core thickness and core shear

Since the panel in this case is not

becomes:

C12. 11. 7 Example Problem.


The example problems demonstrated to this
point have designed the sandwich panel for a
specific stress which the designer must select.
In the case of many structural elements, the
designer can select the design stress for an
efficiently designed structure. However, in
the case of sandwich type structures, the
stress for the best efficiency cannot be chosen
so easily. It can be demonstrated that the
optimum stress level is a function of the
applied load level. The following example
problem will demonstrate a method of optimization and the direct determination of the
optimum stress level. The method will be
demonstrated on the design of a honeycomb
column element.

Figure C12.11.1.


It can clearly be seen from Fig. C12.11.1
that for the lower load levels and for the
7075-T6 aluminum, the yield stress Fcy is not
optimum. The curve also shows the effect of
column length on the optimum stress level.


The optimization problem demonstrated here
is a relatively simple problem. In this case
the area equation was written explicitly in
terms of the facing thickness tF' For the case

terms of the variables and step by step optimization performed through partial differentiation. This method was demonstrated in a
paper by the author entitled "Design Optimization of Aircraft Structures with Thermal
Gradients", Reference (14).

Von Mises Yield Criteria


The deviation of 1i from the Von Mises Yield Criteria
provides a relation from which an effective stress can be
derived for comparison with compression yield of the material. The Von Mises Yield Criteria is one of several
forms for expressing material failure cri terion. Another
n'ime for the S'ime cri terion is distortion energy cri terion.
The criterion relates the onset of ~ross plastic deformation or yielding under various stress conditions. In the
case of compression or tension the yield stress is well
defined by simple tests, however data is not normally available for yield stress levels under combined stress conditions. Thus there is a requirement for such a yield
relation as used in this chaptet to relate the compression
yield stress to an effective yield stress under combined or
non-compressive stresses.

**CHAPTER** **C13**

**FATIGUE**


**By** **Clarence** **R.** **Smith**



_**C13.1**_ **INTRODUCTION**


The fatigue problem relatin~ to metals has
been investigated experimentally for more than
a century. In 1849, Jones and Galton investigated cast iron bars in bending. They found
that failure occurred in fewer than 100,000
cycles if loaded to more than one-third of
ultimate bending strength. Similar work on
wrought iron built-up girders by Fairborn (18601861) showed comparable results. Wohl,>,r's work
for the Pruss ian State Railways goes back to
the 1850' s when he made an extensive sarL3s of
tests of various grades of iron and stsel subjected to repeated direct tensile and compressive loadS, to repeated bending loads, and to
repeated torsional loads.


Airplanes in the past were not SUbjected
to loads experienced by present day high speed
aircraft. Also, they were built of materials
whose tensile strengths were so low that in
order to satisfy static strength requirements,
stresses for service loading would automatically fall wittlin ranges ti1at wnuld provide an
adequate fgtigue life.


The fatigue problem has risen at an alarming rate With present day airplanes in that
they are built of materials which are stronger,
yst have no better (and in some cases, poorer)
fatigue properties than those used fonnerly.
The result has been an accumulation of service
failures, some with fatalities involved. Such
situations have involved the designer in unfamiliar areas. Besides, more accurate methodS
of stress analysis enable us to deSign structures with greater efficiency and precision.
This causes working stresses to more nearly
approach What heretofore had been desie;nated as
limit values. In fact, specifications for
fighter aircraft require fatigue cycling as high
as 1.25 times the design limit loading, while
transports are tested to 1.05 times limit loading.


Those of us Who have experienced a broken
automobile axle while driVing along a perfectly
smooth highway, real1z8 that fatigue f"iilure is
not necessarily caused by a sudden overload or
even a load slightly higher than average. Subsequent examination of the broken part revealed
the tell-tale striations or "beach marks" that
accompany fatigue failures. This is not to say
that fatigue is always accompanied by such
markings; however, it is usually the case. A



typical fatigue faIlure of an airplane rim is
shown in Figure C13.1. Note that the striations started in the highest stressed area of
the radius and progressed outward until final
static failure as evidenced by the outstanding
lip.

**Fig.** _**C13.1**_ **Airplane wheel** **rim** **showing** **striations** **at**
**fatigue** **fracture.**


Fatigue failures can also be identified by
the plain visibility of crystals at trle fracture. This largely accounts for the old belief
that the metal had become crystallized. This
appearance, however, is because fatigue fractures directly through the crystal "transcrystalline failure" as opposed to tearing
apart at the grain boundaries or "intracrystal11n8 failure" of static rupture. Both types of
failure involve metallic crystals and neither
is necessarily more crystalline than the other,
notwithstanding the fact that the crystals in
fatigue failure are better defin8d and more
visibhl.


Fatigue failures originate at some discontinUity as a focal point of crack initiation.
These are called stress concentrations. Prior
to cracking, however, mismrltched atoms called
"dislocations" tend to pile up along grain
boundaries and finally penetrate to cause a
fatigue crack. This l13ppens at a very early
stage; how8var, the visible "engineering" type
crack usually does not occur until more than
50 % of lUe to rupture is consumed.


Cracks, however, will always initate at
the surface unless special surface preparation
or residual compressive stresses are introduced

along the surface. This stems from the fact
that interior atoms are shielded on all sides
by other atoms, while those on the surface have
one side unprotected. Shanley attributes this

failures. More on this later. stress concentrations in terms of gross area is

inapplicable since many lugs, such as rod ends,

chapter. This is because the principles used
in static designs would be sufficient to compensate for the stresses imposed by service
loading. Unfortunately, we do have stress concentrations so that a discussion of this subject
is needed before tackling fatigue.



CI3.2 STRESS CONCENTRATIONS



A stress concentration factor may be defined as a coefficient by which the nominal
stress away from the interruption of stress is
multiplied to reveal actual stress. Handbook
values may vary in that some values are based
on nominal gross area stresses while others are
based on net areas through the least section.
Thus we can have a l-inch wide tensile coupon
having a centrally drilled hole of 1/4-inch
diameter whose concentration factor turns out
to be 3.2 when based on stress through the
section away from the hole. However, if based
on net area through the hole, the concentration
turns out to be 2.4.


Some handbook values for stress concentrations may vary for the same configuration and
loading condition. This might be because some
may have been derived mathematically, while
others experimentally through the use of photoelasticity or other experimental stress analysis
techniques. A common value assessed for the
concentration at the edge of a hole in a Wide
sheet is 3. Obviously, as the hole increases
in size in comparison to sheet Width, the concentration based on gross area stress becomes
larger. The stress concentration for a pin
loaded hole can vary from infinity for a very
small pin in a wide sheet to about 4.5 where
the sheet is 2.5 times the hole diameter and
then up to higher values where the hole diameter is very nearly the Width of the sheet.
This is illustrated in Fig. C13.2 where stress
concentrations for pin loaded holes and unloaded
holes are presented for a sheet loaded in tension. Here we see that the concentration for a
lug in terms of gross area stress away from the
hole is least at alb ratios of about 0.4 (2.5
hole diameters), where a is the hole diameter
and b is lug Width. Since a mechanically
fastened joint is essentially a number of lugs
side by side, it follows that the optimum
fastener spacing would be about 2.5 diameters.
Such a joint would have an efficiency

In practically every case involving a
stress concentration, the stress gradient is
very steep as shown in Fig. C13.4 by the
photoelastic pattern caused by a sharp edgenotch in a wide sheet loaded in tension. Here
the number of dark lines (fringes) are directly
proportional to stress. This is further illustrated in Fig. C13.5 where the stress gradient
from the edge of a hole in a wide sheet loaded
in tension is given in terms of radii from edge
of hole.

Fig. CI3.5      - Stress distribution at edge of

The steep gradient at tile concentration
has particular significance in that stresses at
concentrations can be manipUlated at the expense of stresses a short distance away from
the concentration. Thus we have such practices
as shot peening, surface nitriding, and others
which shift the stress at the concentration to
more favorable locations.


Other geometrical stress concentrations are
given in Figs. C13.6, 13.7, and 13.8. The term
"geometrical stress concentration" is used here
to distinguish it from the term "fatigue stress

C13.3 FATIGUE DATA


CI3.3.1 Unnotched Data


Unnotched dat~ in fatigue are comparable to
static properties as determined by the standard
tensile coupon. As the static stress-strain
curves describe static properties, the S-N
curves describe basic fatigue properties. The
term "basic" is used here to designate a fundamental property of a given material. This is
not in agreement With S-N data for notched
sDecimens where residual machining stresses can

i~fluence results by more than 10 times, thereby eliminating them from the realm of basic
material properties. While it might be argued
that e-N curves would be even more basic, we
will use S-N data because of being more available in handbooks.


Whereas static properties are presented in
terms of tension and/or compressive yield and
ultimate strengths, fatigue data are presented
for many intermediate values and manners of
loading. To facilitate description, the term
Stress Ratio (R) is used, the definition being
R = Smin;Smax' Accordingly, for loading. from 0
to maximum stress, the stress ratio, R, 1S
O/Smax = O. For reversed loading, Smin is

e~lal and of opposite sign to Smax in Which
case, R = -1. The nomenclature for conventional
laboratory fatigue testing is presented in Fig.
C13.9. A Family of S-N curves for 7075-T6
aluminum alloy is given in Figure C13.10. Here,
the solid lines represent average (log mean)
values for aXially loaded O.l-inch thick sheet
material. Dashed lines are interpolations to
aid estimating intermediate values.


Frequently fatigue data are presented in
termS of constant mean stress or constant ratio
of alternating stress to mean stress. The use



Time ~

of such curves are largely dependent on individual preference; however, for convenience, the
data are generally presented in constant life
or modified Goodman diagrams as shown in Fig.
C13.l1.(8) Here, life for any given stress
ratio can be found by the intercept of appropriate life with the diagonal lines. It is
usually necessary to interpolate between life
lines for actual values. As seen inFlg. C13.11,
lives are given for even exponents with intermediate values of 4 x the previous increment.


EXAMPLE 1) Find the life for cycling at R = 0
and a maximum stress of 50 KSI
(Ref. Fig. C13.1l)


Reading from the maximum stress scale
at 50 KSI, we see that the life is
about midway between 4 x l~ and loa
cycles. Considering that life is
presented on the basis of logarithmic
values, we find that life. should be
slightly over 60,000 cycles.


2) Find the life for cycling: 20 KSI
over a mean stress of 30 KSI.


Along the line for 30 KSI mean
stress, we see the intercept for
alternating stress to be at lOa

cycles. Note that this same intercept gives a maximum stress of 50 KSI
at R = +0.2. The value of A = 0.67
is simply the ratio of 20 KSI/30 KSI.


While the presentation of data as shown in
Figure C13.11 has become more common in recent
years, it is usually easier to interpolate life
for a given stress when Dlotted as in Fig.
C13.10. In addition, the curves shown in Fig.
C13.101end themselves for visually demonstrating possible corrections for fatigue critical
situations. This will be discussed in detail
later.

CI3.6 FATIGUE



CI3. 3. 2 Notched Data


Notched data are used to demonstrate
fatigue properties of a material in the presence of stress concentrations. This provides a
comparison for use with built-up structures
having an equivalent concentration. For service life predictions, which will be discussed in
detail later, it is common practice to design a
structure to some known stress concentration
factor and assume that it would behave as a
specimen having an equivalent stress concentration. While it is usually too expensive to
develop an S-N curve for a full-scale structural
component during early stages of design, it is
common practice to make spot checks at one or
two points to deter~ine the validity of the
stress concentration assumed for design. This
assures the airplane's ability to pass the
fatigue tests required of the complete airframe
before certification is granted - at least on
the particular component involved.


S-N curves for axially loaded specimens of
7075-T6 having theoretical concentration factors
(Kt) of 1 (unnotched), 2.6 (center hole notched),
and 3.6 (small lugs) are given in Figure C13.12.
Kt values are given in terms of net area. A
fourth curve (Theoretical for Kt = 2.6) is
shown for comparison with the curve generated
by testing. Here it is seen that the theoretical curve (S-N curve for Kt = 1 divided by 2.6)
falls short of the experimental curve except at
about 10 [7] cycles. It is generally conceded
that the reason for experimental values being
higher is because of beneficial residual
stresses acquired by plastic deformation at the
notch in the short life ranges.


Were we to divide the stress for a given
life as shown by the curve for unnotched specimens (Kt = 1) by the stress eXhibited by the
notched specimens at the same life, we would
end up with a factor which is commonly called a
"fatigue notch factor". The fatigue notch
factor, (defined as Kf=
nominal maximum stress, unnotched specimen
nominal maximum stress,notched specimen, same life)
is usually lower than Kt. An exception eXists,
however, where fretting is involved. Accordingly, we see that at long life, the K for small
lugs is about 5.5 instead of the theoretical
3.6 as derived from the geometric configuration.
Fretting is a term used for damage caused by
rubbing of solid surfaces in contact under
pressure.


The above comparisons point to a very important factor in that there is a difference
in the effects of stress concentration, depending on whether or not rubbing surfaces are involved. Virtually all mechanically fastened



joints fall into the "closed notch or fretting
sensitive region" and therefore need to be
treated differently from the simple notch or
"open concentration". Commercial airliners are
particularly sensitive to fretting because of
their long-life expectancy.


While all stress concentrations found by
ratioing unnotched to notched fatigue data are
fatigue stress concentrations, the validity of
many notched data can usually be determined by
comparing with the theoretical value at about
10 [7] cycles. The fatigue notch factor and theoretical stress concentration should be equal at
this point. If not, the fault may lie in
residual stresses set up by machining the
notches. A dull drill will usually introduce
a residual compressive stress which causes the
specimen to last longer than it shoUld. Such
data would be unconservative for design purposes.


An exception to the above is the very
sharp notch. Neuber has shown that the notch
effect is less if very sharp in that the notch
cannot be smaller than a grain of the material
involved. (10)

CI3. 3. 3 Endurance Limit


Endurance li~it is defined as the maximum
stress below which a material can presumably
endure an infinite number of stress cycles.
While many materials, including steels, exhibit
a definite stress below which fatigue failure
will not occur, aluminum and many other alloys
have no specific endurance limit. Accordingly,
a fatigue limit for those metals is defined as
that stress corresponding to a life of
200,000,000 cycles.


CI3. 3. 4 Fatigue Testing Machines


The above data Nere acquired by fatigue
testing axially loaded specimens at frequencies varying from about 1200 cpm to about 1800
cpm. Practically all commercially available
axial loading fatigue machines are of the
constant-load type - that is, special provision
is made for maintaining proper loading even
though the specimen may experience creep. An

a~tomatic shut-off and cycle count is provided
to record cycles at specimen failure.


Another type of data not heretofore mentioned is that of reversed bending and/or torsion. Most early data on steels were acquired
by rotary beam tests Which flex the specimen in
reverse bending. This supposedly simulated
fatigue failures of railroad car axles whose
service loading was in reverse bending. Unfortunately, the rotary beam tests do not lend
themselves to testing at stress ratios other
than at R = -1.


J. Goodman (10) used a special technique for
converting reverse bending data to stress ratios
other than R = -1. Fig. C13.13 shows a Goodman
Diagram for the 7075-T6 aluminum alloy specimens
which were used to develop the data for Fig.

Cl~.lO. In this diagram the maXimum, mean, and
minimum stresses are ordinates to the curves
and the abscissas are any convenient scale. The
ultimate tensile strength is first plotted and
the straight line of mean stress drawn to it at
zero abscissa. stresses for cycling at R = -1
are then plotted along the ordinate axis for
appropriat·e 11 ves - in this case loe, loe, and
10 [4] cycles. Connecting lines are then drawn to
the point representing the ultimate tensile
strength of the material at one abscissa.


EXAMPLE 1) The stress for loe cycles at R = -1
is ~ 30 KSI. Find stress for R = O.


Note that the intercept for loe

cycles and zero stress is at abscissa
0.27. Note maXimum stress to be 44
KSI for loe cycles at abscissa 0.27.
Note that this is in aggrement with
the stress shown on the S-N curve for
R = 0 in Fig. C13.10.



CI3.7


2) The stress for 10 [4] cycles at R = -1
is ~ 51 KSI. Find Stress for R = O.


Note that the intercept for 10 [4]
cycles and zero stress is at abscissa
0.39. Maximum stress is found to be
63 KSI at the same abscissa. This
does not agree With the S-N curve for
R = 0 and 10 [4] cycles in Fig. C13.10
Where the maximum stress is shown to
be 73KSI.


Values for stress ratios other than zero are
estimated by scaling between appropriate life
lines, moving right or left until finding the
desired stress ratio. A good pair of dividers
helps. However, a better way is to replot data
on a modified Goodman diagram (Ref. Fig.
C13.11). Using the mean stress line as independent coordinate, plot maximum stresses whereever they happen to fall and draw constant life
curves. Note that the curves will be straight
lines, whereas those shown in Fig. C13.11 are
curved. Fig.,C13.11 was plotted from actual
data for a number of stress ratios. Lack of
agreement between the two is an indication of
the reliability of the Goodman diagram.

values. Usually there is but little difference
between the two. The designer, accordingly,
has to use discretion in allowing for test
scatter when using handbook data. Statisticians
use a factor called standard deviation,(17),
usually identified by the Greek letter cr, or
Sigma, which relates scatter data to reliabilit~

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-892-0.png)


Fig. C13.15    - Bell curve indicates probabilities of
fatigue failure based on standard deviations from
average life of 10 [5] cycles. Standard deviation is
assumed to be 0.1 based on log-normal distribution.


Standard deviation takes into account the number
of specimens and data spread. In terms of percentages, 99.9% of a group of specimens are expected to have lives in excess of 30 below the
average. For example, if the average life of a
group of specimens is 100,000 cycles (10 [6] ), and
the standard deviation is 0.1 based on lognormal distribution, then the so-called guaranteed life would be 10(5 -0.3) =10 [4 ] . [7] whose
antilog is about 51,000 cycles. A diagram of
assumed test lives in terms of standard deviations is presented in Fig. C13.15.


The standard deviation, Sigma, is 0.1 in
this ex~mple since it happens to be a good value
for a life of about 10 [6] cycles. Further,
averages for full-scale tests on airplanes at
the Naval Air Engineering Center, Philadelphia(18) and the Aeronautical Research Laboratories, Melbourne, Australia(19) indicate that
0.1 is a good average value for Sigma on fullscale structures.


Standard deviation, or Sigma, is very important in comparing the relative merits of
fastened assemblies where cycles to failure are
in the neighborhood of 100,000 cycles. For
example, assume that specimens joined With
Fastener A average 100,000 cycles to failure for
a given loading while speci'llens with Fastener B
average 200,000 cycles. Sigma is 0.1 for specimens With Fastener A. However, there is more
scatter in data for specimens with Fastener B
so the standard deviation is 0.2 based on the
logarithm of average life.



C13.9


For a guaranteed minimum life of 3a below
the respective average lives, it was found that
specimens with Fastener A can be expected to
last a minimum of 50,000 cycles. In the case
of Fastener B, where average life is 200,000
cycles, but with a standard deviation of 0.2,
the logarithm of 200,000 is 5.3010. From this
value, 3 x 0.20 (30) is subtracted to obtain
4.7010, whose antilogarithm shows the life to
be 50,000 cycles. This is no better than specimens fastened with Fastener A With its 100,000
cycle average life.


The value of Sigma, however, is highly dependent on actual life, especially for small
unnotched specimens. Where lives exceed one
million cycles, Sigma may exceed one or more.
At this point, the significance of a standard
deviation based on life disappears and other
statistical methods must be employed. ASTM's
Special Technical Publication No. STP-9lA is a
good source of information for use of statistics for fatigue.


C13. 3. 6 Load-N Curves


Load-N curves are frequently used Where
stress is unknown. Usually plotted in percentage of breaking strength, they are valuable in
that structures are designed in terms of limit
or ultimate loads. Fig. C13.16 presents data
comparing lives of airplane structures in terms
of ultimate failing loads. (18) All of the
structures shown are of World War II vintage
where design for fatigue resistance was not a
requirement. None would pass present day
fatigue requirements. The author has demonstrated that such structures would have to last
for 30,000 or more cycles at limit loading
(66.7% of ultimate) in order to pass tests required of an airplane designed for 4000 hours
of service. Note that the P51 wing would sustain only 40% of Ultimate for a life of 30,000
cycles.

Load-N Curves Comparing Fatigue Strengths of
Unnotched 2024-T3 and 7075-T6 Aluminum Alloys


Fig. C13.16 are Load-N curves which compare
strengths of unnotched specimens of 2024-T3 and
7075-T6 aluminum alloys. Here we see that for a
30,000 cycle life that 2024-T3 (lower strength
alloy) will sustain 82 percent of its ultimate
strength whereas 7075-T6 (higher strength alloy)
will sustain but 68 percent of its ultimate
strength. The 30,000 cycle life, as in the previous paragraph, is used as a fatigue strength
index for comparative purposes on a 4000-hour
airplane. Comparisons for a 50,000-hour airplane should probably be made at a different
life. Irrespective of which particulAr life is
chosen, the graphs do show Why fatigue problems
have become more prevalent and illustrate Why
special emphasis on fatigue is important when
designing with higher strength alloys.


What has been said of aluminum alloys is
also true of steels. Steels, however, especially of 200 ksi and higher strengths, are vulnerable to flaws which reduce fatigue life.


Tests reported by Cummings, Stulen, and
Schulte on SAE ~)40 steel having inclusions
ranging between 0.001 and 0.003-inch diameter,
showed that material heat treated between 200
and 250 ksi lasted only 1/4 as long as the same
steel heat treated between 100 and 150 ksi.
This steel heat treated between 250 and 300 ksi
had even shorter life. Where inclusions were
smaller than 0.00025-in. diameter, however,
fatigue strengths were more or 18 ss proportional
to their ultimate strengths.


C13. 3. 7 Elevated Temperature



beyond the scope of the present chapter, a few
salient facts concerning elevated temperature
properties are in order:


1. It is not only the temperature, but
the time at temperature that influences
life. Referring to the curves on
6Al-4V titanium alloy shown in the appendix, we see that tests were made at
1850 cpm. Accordingly, the data are
correct for the duration of the tests.
Allowance should be made for periods
of longer duration .


2. In general, static properties are reduced as much or more than fatigue
properties at elevated temperatures.
While this does not nullify the need
for fatigue analysis, static considerations may make fatigue problems less
acute.


3. Stresses due to thermal expansion or
contraction need to be considered.
These mayor may not be additive to
flight loads.


4. The effects of superposition of creep
plus fatigue are not well defined at
present. Due to the time reqUired for
creep testing, but meager data are
available. These were more or less
acqUired on accelerated tests.


C13.5 INCREASING FATIGUE RESISTANCE


CI3.5.1 Introduction


The need for increasing fatigue resistance
should be obvious by now. As probably anticipated from the stress concentrations shown in
Figs. C13.2 through C13.8, most structural
failures due to fatigue are likely to occur at

holes--parti~ularly those having fasteners
loaded in shear. Accordingly, each structural
splice would behave more or less as a series of
pin-loaded lugs where concentration is higher
than for simple unloaded holes or even fillet
radii. This is not to say that fillet radii
may not also be critical, the point here is
simply that the first place to look for trouble
would be in mechanically fastened joints.


Although most fatigue failures of airplane
structures have been at fastener holes, notches
and fillets have also taken their tolls. In
looking at handbook values for stress concentrations in fillets of all kinds, it would appear
that it would be impossible to have a fillet so
poor that failure would not occur first at
fastener hol'3S.



While fatigue properties of metals at elevated Using the lug analogy for shear-loaded
temperatures is a stUdy within itself and is fasteners, one explanation for almost as many


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-894-full.png)

failures at fillets could be that stresses at
loaded fasteners cannot be reversed even though
load is completely reversed, whereas a reversal
of load would reverse stress at an open hole or
fillet radius. This is shown in Fig. C13.18
where a sponge rUbber lug loaded in tension (A)
and compression (B) show the deformations at
the edge of the lug to be in tension for either
load direction.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-894-0.png)

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-894-1.png)


Fig. _C13._ 18 - Sponge rubber model of lug ruled
with white lines is loaded in Tension _(A)_ and in
compression (B). Stress at concentration causes
tension stress for both.

The model is ruled with white lines which
are about O.lO-inch apart when unloaded. Since
the tensile stresses for compressive loading
result from shear transfer from compressively
loaded material away from the hole, the tensile
stresses due to compressive loading cannot be as
high as when loaded directly in tension. Nevertheless, a complete reversal of load results in
two tensile stresses of unequal magnitude.
Since the location of peak tensile stresses due
to compressive and tensile loading are slightly
removed from one another, and the stress due to



_CI3.11_


tensile loading is the hi~hest, it follows that
failure should always occur at the high stress
point for tensile loading. Accordingly, tensile
stresses due to compressive loading could be
ignored insofar as fatigue life calculations are
concerned for reversed loading; however, they
must be considered where loading is primarily
in compression. This is clearly shown in Table
II where test data are presented to compare
lives of small lugs sUbjected to tension-tension
and reversed loading. There is no indication
that reversed loading is more harmful than
tension-tension loading.


The behavior of metals under static and
cyclic loading conditions now will be considered
to provide an understanding of what can be done
to improve fatigue life of structures. Beginning
with static stress-strain properties of simple

specimens and continuing with S-N data for unnotched specimens, the behavior of stresses at
a notch will be likened to stresses in unnotched static and fatigue specimens to see
what happens in a structure.


Although most design analyses are made in
terms of stress, it is very important to consider strain where deformations exceed the elastic
limit of a given material.


Normally, the specified limit loading condition assumes no plastic deformation. However,
in view of stresses that may be encountered at
stress concentrations, it is unlikely that a
structure can be designed Where absolutely no
local plastic deformation will occur during the
lifetime of the structure.


Limit load, at least for airplane structures, is defined as a working load which can
be Withstood Without any permanent deformation


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-895-full.png)

C13.12 FATIGUE



that will impair the performance of the vehicle.
Ultinate load usually is defined as 1.5 times
the limit load. However, this safety factor
may vary depending on the particular circlw
stances in each case.


The material used in the illustrative
examples throughout the remainder of this chapter will be 7075-T6 aluminum alloy because of
its almost universal use in airplane structures.
Although the principles involved here will apply to other alloys and structures, airplane
structures will be considered primarily because
of their fatigue sensitivity and the number of
mechanical fasteners used.

characteristics of a structure than any other
single item.


To further explain this behavior of materials, consider a structure which has a stress
concentration of 4 and stress at limit load of
25 ksi based on an average cross-sectional area.
If this structure were made of a brittle material with an ultimate strength of 83 ksi (for
comparison with 7075-T6), the structure would
fail because 4 x 25 ksi = 100 ksi.

C13. 5.2 Stress, Strain & Plastic Deformation


A stress-strain curve for 7075-T6 aluminum
alloy is shown in Fig. C13.19. Here it is seen
that the yield strength is about 75 ksi with
ultimate breaking strength of 83 ks!. Although
the rated modulus of elasticity, E, is
10,500,000 psi, for t1lis and subsequent discussions involving aluminum alloys, we will use 10
million psi as a good round number.


Supposedly, the behavior of this material
at a stress concentration would be very much as
shown in Fig. C13.19 only with this difference:
the stress is not based on the entire cross
sectional area, but on a very small area at the
point of highest stress. When localized yielding occurs, the small increment of area at the
stress concentration will refuse to carry additional load (even though the load actually is
increased) and the material adjacent to the
stress concentration will be forced to carry a
larger share of the load.


This ability of material to shed load by
yielding at a concentration, along with the
residual stresses which result from yielding,
has more importance in fatigue strength



However, if the structure were 7075-T6
having stress-strain properties as shown in Fig.
C13.19, the material would yield locally, transferring the excess load to the yet unyielded
adjacent material.


Obviously, the 25 ksi average stress would
not fail the structure so that the local yielding would have to stop when the load carrying
ability of the yielded plus unyielded material
averaged 25 ksi. Exactly when thiS occurs is
not known, however, a good guess can be made by
considering the stress concentration to be a
strain concentration. That is, the strain corresponding to 25 ksi nominal stress multiplied
by 4 to get the maximum strain at the concentration and the maximum stress is found from the
stress-strain curve. Assuming E = 10 million
psi, we find



E nom . =



25,000

and Emax



= 4 x 0.0025 =



0.0025 in/in


0.010 in/in



From Fig. C13.19,



       Smax = 76 ksi



 Units such as ksi and psi are intermingled here for semantics. While most S-N data are given in ksi, we say E = 10
million psi rather than 10 thousand ksi.


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-896-full.png)

Having yielded locally, the local material
now is longer than the remainder so that when
the structure is unloaded, thiS permanently
elongated material is forced into compression by
the relatively larger bulk of material trying to
return to its original point of zero strain. An
analogy to this condition is something like
trying to fit an old cork back into a bottle.
If the area of the yielded material were very
small compared to the area of the remainl.ng
material, there would be no apparent permanent
set; however, a residual stress of 25 ksi would
result as graphically illustrated in Fig.C13.20.


Increasing tensile deformation would cause
greater amounts of permanent set with correspondingly greater values of residual stress.
However, it would be inconceivable that a residual stress greater than the compressive yield
for the material could be introduced, no matter
how high the preceding tensile load. Even if it
were pOSSible to introduce a greater amount,
given time, the residual stress would relax to
a value below the compressive yield. Actual
retainable valiles are not known; however, experience in the shot-peening industry indicates
that up to two-thirds of the compressive yield
strength can be retained indefinitely at ambient
temperature.


Measurements of strains at a hole in a wide
sheet show rate of strain to increase after
reaching the plastic state. (21) This would imply an even larger a~ount of residual stress
than ass~med; however, since greater strain
would increase the ratio of Pias~ic areas, the
e as c
strain would not return to zero on unloading.
ThUS, the linear assumption incorporates 2
errors that more or less cancel each other when
used for estimating residual stress.(22)


The accuracy of the linear strain concept
is not in contention at this point, however, it
does illustrate the presence of some residual
compressive stress at a concentration after a
high preload. Conversely, one would expect a
residual tenSile stress to exist after yielding
in compression. It also explains why some
fatigue failures occur in structures which are
subjected to NOTHING BUT COMPRESSIVE LOADS.
More on this later.


C13. 5. 3 Effect of Residual Stress on Fatigue


The locked-in residual stress at a point of
stress concentration causes a preloaded structure to behave in a manner different from a
structure which has never been loaded to the
point of local yielding.


For example, if the loading were such as to
cause stressing at the concentration to be from
o to 60 ksi, one would expect that where pre


C13.13


loading caused a residual compressive stress of
-30 ksi, the loading which previously caused 0
to 60 ksi in the virgin structure would result
in ~ 30 ksi in the preloaded structure. While
the original life of such a structure would be
25,000 cycles (see Fig. C13.10, Smax = 60 ksi,
R = 0) the preloaded structure would last for
100,000 cycles (see Fig. C13.10, Smax = 30 ksi,
R = -1).


Similarly, if preloading were such as to
leave a residual stress of -40 ksi, the life
for cycling at R = 0 would be found to be

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-896-0.png)


Fig. C 13.21 - Examples show changes in fatigue life with
addition of residual stress at concentration. All test samples are cycled at the same load which produces a stress
range of 60,000 psi.


200,000 cycles (see Fig. C13.10, Smax = -2).
Since the definition of R is Smin;8max' being
of minus sign, the -40 ksi stress is lower than
+20 ksi, even though numerically larger. Thus,
we can have stress ratios of -10 or even minus
infinity. The above calculations are presented
graphically in Fig. C13.21.


C13. 5. 4 Mechanically Introduced Residual Stresses


In the above discussion, the compressive residual stress was introduced by overloading so
as to cause local yielding. There are, however,
many other methods of acquiring favorable residual stresses, perhaps the best known is shot
peening. As the name implies, peening is accomplished by small round shot under air pressure which blast the slITface concerned. The
part to be peened is placed in an enclosure
that traps the used shot and returns them to a
reservoir. Special mechanical arms or rubber
arm protectors permit handling parts being
peened.


Shot sizes range from 0.007 to 0.175-inch
diameter. Large shot sizes are used to produce
deep layers of compressive stress; small shot
sizes are used to reach into small radii.
Velocities range from 100 to 200 ft/sec.


Since the object of shot peening is to obtain a layer of compressive material on the
surface, completeness may be checked visually


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-897-full.png)

C13.14 FATIGUE



by coverage of shot impressions. However,
peening works even when the shot is no harder
than the surfact to be peened, in which case
it may not leave a visible dimple. To overcome these difficulties, the Almen(23) gage is
used. The Almen gage is nothin~ more than a
strip of steel (Hardness 47 Rc ) which when shot
peened on one side causes the metal to hump on
the peened side. The Almen intensity is simply
the arc height of the strip as measured with
dial indicator. ThUs, an intensity of 12-14
Almen A means that tlle arc height of an A strip
(0.051-inch thick) is 0.012 to 0.014-in.

Fig. C13.22 - Shot Peening Wheel -- Cast Steel Shot is
Randomly Bonded to Flaps with Resilient Adhesive.


While conventional shot peening works well
for removable parts, problems frequently arise
in structures already built. Special hammer
peening has been used for accessible fillet
radii and holes(24). A more recent development
the in the shot way peening of portable wheel called peening Roto Peen. tools is that - Com- of

C13.22) which extend from a steel mandrel and

Fig. C13.23 compares residual stresses
obtained by two methods of peening. Although
two distinct curves are sh~wn, the data are too
meager to statistically determine that an
actual difference exists. It is known throughout the shot peening industry that incomplete

Depth Below Surface (Mils)


Fig. C13.23 - Comparison of Residual Stresses Produced by
Two Methods of Peening.


Although shot peening is probably the most
popular method for acquiring a beneficial residual compressive stress, other methods of providing a residual stress include "bearingizing:
"coining", and cold rolling. Bearingizing is
a trade n&~e used by the Cogsdill Tool Products,
Inc. This method consists of inserting a shaft
with tight fitting surface rollers into the
holes to be treated. This produces a burnishing
effect on the sides of the holes.


COining(26) consists of pressing a concentric groove around the hole or opening to be
protected. This squeezes the material adjacent
to the hole inward such that the hole diameter
is decreased and the amount of compressive residual stress is dependent on the depth of the
coin. Generally, the bigger the radius, the
greater the residual stress.


Cold rolling is a common practice in preparing bolt threads and under-head radii. An
example of the benefits gained in this manner
is shown in Fig. C13.24.

Should Smax - Smin turn out to be
greater than 51 kSi, the life mould be
more than the needed for 500,000 cycles
which is fine, provided that the residual stress is within a range where
relaxation is not a problem.



Fig. C13.26 shows the same part as used in the
previous example; however, appropriate dimensions are added. Suppose that the original
part lasted but 10,000 cycles and a life of
500,000 cycles is needed. How do we go about
acquiring the needed life?



Using the same procedure as in the
previous problem, we see that the
maximum stress must have been about 74
ksi (Fig. C14.10, R = 0, N = 10 [4] ).


Obviously, more residual stress is
needed than in the previous problem,
so we go directly to R = -4 where Smax

is found to be 12 ksi at 500,000
cycles. Smin would be -4 x 12 = -48
ksi, and the stress range turns out to
be 60 ksi Which is short of the 74 ksi
needed.


Even if we went to R = -8 (Smax = 8 ks i,
Smin = -64 kSi), the 64 ksi residual
stress would be more than we could hold
because of relaxation.



Step 4. Let's assume R ~ -1. We find Smax at
500,000 cycles to be 23 ksi.

Step 5. The new stress range is 74 ksi x
1.26/1.86 = 50 ksi


Step 6. Now that we have a reasonable stress
range to work with, we treat the
problem exactly as in the previous
example.

practically all steels can benefit or suffer
from such processing.



strength by shot peening prior to plating, as
shown in Fig. C13.2S. (27) While chrome plating
is used extensively for wear and corrosion resistance, caution should be taken where plating
covers fatigue critical radii, etc. In such
cases, the shot peening might be required to
bring the part up to fatigue reqUirements even
without the chrome. Thus, to bring the strength
back to original properties is not enough and
other corrosion inhibitors plus shot peening is
needed. A mixture of cadmium plate in fatigue
critical areas (plus shot peening) with chromium only at wear surfaces might be the answer.
Some aircraft companies make it a point to prohibit chromeplate within liS-inch of the point
of tangency of a fillet.

wear surface. For that reason, its use in
aircraft would be in the nature of roller surfaces, such as on flap tracks.


Carburizing or "case hardening", while producing
excellent wear surface on steels, may introduce
either compression or tensile residual stresses.
Accordingly, its presence as a fatigue deterrent is questionable.



Tests on aluminum alloys showed similar
improvements(2S); however, prestressing above
50 ksi caused all benefits to be lost. The
one preloaded specimen shown in Fig. C13.29
did not indicate a damaging effect due to preloading for steels.


While Chrome-ite apparently has little to
do with residual compressive stresses, it was
included at this point so as to be adjacent to
the discussion on chrome plating where a reSidual compressive stress is a must. Why there
should be an increase in fatigue life is a
matter of conjecture at this pOint; however,

similar improvements have been achieved by
coating specimens with kerosene or other oleophobic films. (29)


Discussion of Benefits Due to Compressive
Residual Stresses


In Example Problem (1) we assumed tln.t the
maximum stress at the concentration was 51 ksi
because that happened to have been the maximum
stress corresponding to a life of 50,000 cycles
at R = O. This would be true only if no residule stresses were present at the time of testing. Had there been residual compressive
stresses due to machining or other, an increase
in compressive stress by peening would probably
be of little benefit. On the other hand, had
there been a residual tenRile stress, peening
would not only remove the tensile stress, but
introduce favorable compressive stresses Which
would increase life even more than estimated
in Problem (1).


Whereas we cannot always tell whether
residual stresses are present in a structure,
should a part fail at fewer than 10,000 cycles
for tension-tenslon loading, we can feel sure
that some plastic deformation exists. In such
a case any residual tensile stress would have
been wiped out because of local yielding and
local yielding would have introduced some



_C13.17_


residual compressive stresses in any event.
This would limit the value of introducing
additional residual compressive stress by peening or other methods.


For example, let us assume that the original part failed after 2500 cycles and that
there was no way to reduce the stress concentration as in example (2). In Viewing the stressstrain curve shown in Figure C13.19, we see that
the yield strength of 7075-T6 was ~5 ksi. Also
we see that a substantial amount of strain could
be tolerated without an appreciable increase in
stress.


Let us aSSTh~e that the maximum stress at
concentration (corresponding to a 2500 cycle
life) was 76 ksi, the reason being that very
little more stress would cause the entire cross
sectional area to yield. At this point, however, it is not too important whether the actual
stress is 76, 77, or 80 ksi, the argument being
that whatever the maximum stress, the minimum
stress could not be zero, but some negative
value. This would be true even if the entire
cross section yielded, as the elastic return
would cause compression at the concentration.


Continuing with our assumption that the
maximum stress was 76 ksi, we find that the
life of 2500 cycles intercepts the S-N curve for

CI3.I8 **FATIGUE**



R = -0.5 at 76 ksi (Ref. Fig. C13.l0). This
would indicate that the minimum stress, by
definition, would be -0.5 x 76 ksi = -38 ksi.
Let us further assume that a compressive stress
of -50 ksi could be achieved by shot peening.
Since the total stress range is 76 ksi (-38 ksi) = 114 ksi, the maximum stress of the
peened structure would be 114 - 50 ksi = 64 ksi
for the same loading. The corresponding stress
ratio would be -50}64 = -0.78 where life is
found in Fig. C13.10 to be about 4000 cycles or
less than double the original life.


The above points to the fact that a certain
amount of caution is needed in determining
whether or not a problem can be solved by introducing residual compressive surfaces
stresses. In Problem (1), we found that it
would take a residual stress of but -36 ksi to
increase life by more than a factor of ten.
Accordingly, if the life increase needed is ten
times or more, compressive surface stresses
would help only if maximum stresses in service
did not cause localized yielding. This would
be true whether or not loading is of a constant
a~plitude or variable-amplitude nature.


Although cold working as in the above in
itself might be considered as an improvement in
material properties, tests on aluminum alloys
have not born this out. Unnotched specimens of
7075-T6 can be stretched 4% prior to fatigue
testing with no change in fatigue life. Accordingly, it can be assumed, at least for heat
treatable aluminum alloys, that any benefits
achieved by cold working are due to beneficial
residual stresses.


CI3. 5. 6 Increasing Rigidity


The following discussion has to do With
increase of fatigue life by reducing stress
amplitude through change of spring constant of
a structure. Again referring to the S-N curves
in Fig. C13.10, the curve for R = +0.5 is of
special interest. Here it can be seen t hat a
structure which lasts 50,000 cycles when loaded
at R = 0 could be made to last almost indefinitely if the stress could be made to cycle at
R = +0.5. In other words, a substantial increase in fatigue life will result if the
minimum stress can be "propped up" even though
the maximum stress remains unchanged or even
slightly higher.


Torquing a bolt is a good example of how
this "propping" effect can be achieved. However, general consensus is that a bolt torqued
to a stress higher than the working stress
remains static. What really happens is that
the torqued bolt makes use of the extra rigidity
of the abutting material to reduce stress
amplitude.



This is more easily understood by visualiZing a bolt which cycles as shown in Fig.
C13.30. The cyclic amplitUde shown here is exaggerated for easy visualization.

Analogy of Stress for Loose and Pretorqued Bolts


Now suppose with the load fully applied,
slotted washers are inserted in the gap as
shown in Fig. C13.30 (right). The washers prevent the stress from returning to zero; however, they do not influence the maximum stress
as shown by the clearance between washers and
shackle. What this means is that the washers
have added to the stiffness of the bolt so that
the stress amplitUde shown in Fig. C13.30 (right)
is exactly the same as though the area of the
bolt were increased by the cross-sectional areas
of the washers.


Since the bolt experiences tensile stresses
while resting on the washers in the unloaded
position, the same effect can be achieved by
torquing the bolt to the same tightness as when
unloaded and resting on the washers.


Torquing to higher tensile stress will not
change the stress amplitude as the amplitude is
determined by the combined factors of bolt
stiffness and abutment material (shackles in
this case). However, maximum stress is increased and, therefore, a reduction in fatigue
life will follow as compared With the fatigue
life when exactly the right ffiTIount of torque is
applied.


Accordingly, there is no point in using
exceedingly high torque values unless loading
is exceptionally high. This means that there
is only one torque value that is optimum for a
given loading condition. In the exanple given
in Fig. C13.30, the torque value would permit


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-902-full.png)

the shackle to float clear when fully loaded.
Thus, the torque does not increase the stress
due to loading.


This principle of increased rigidity for
added fatigue life applies to interference-type
fasteners. Interference fit introduces residual tensile stresses around the periphery of a
hole which are not beneficial per se; however,
they do permit structures to gain extra stiffness afforded by the fastener. The interference
fastener serves as a seat on which the stressed
material rests when unloaded, very much like
the stack of washers in the bolt example.


A graph of taper pin interference versus
fatigue life of lugs tested at 12 ksi (gross
area stress, R = 0.1) is shown in Fig. C13.31.
Note that a drop in fatigue life is experienced
after 0.0035-inch interference. This agrees
with the previous statement regarding one
torque value being optimum for a given loading.
The lugs were O.l-in. thick 7075-T6, 1.31inches Wide and were loaded through _3/8-inch_
diameter taper pins.

Schematic diagrams of stress cycling which
correspond to interferences of zero, 0.002,

The amplitude for 0.008-inch interference is
the same as for the O.0035-inch interference;
however, maximum stress is increased by too
much interference.


Although 0.008-inch interference produced
a shorter life than where 0.0035-inch interference was used, fatigue life was still greater
than where no interference was used, indicating
a wide tolerance of interference fits for
fatigue life improvements. Too much interferference, however, will invite stress corrosion
when fasteners are installed in an adverse grain
direction.

Fig. C13.32 - Schematic diagrams of stress cycle for lugs
loaded with 3/8-inch diameter taper pins show how fatigue
life is affected by interference type fasteners. It is assumed
that no increase in maximum stress results from interferences below 0.0035-inch. The amplitude for 0.008-inch
interference is the same as for O. 0035-inch interference,
however, the maximum stress is raised which accounts for
shorter life.


The previous discussion is further confirmed by tests on 3.75-inch wide lugs where
interferences as high as 0.010 (0.008-in./in.)
were used. The hole diameter was 1.25 inches,
giving a theoretical stress concentration of
3.5. Bushings of hardened steel having wall
thickness of _1/4_ and _1/8_ inch were pressed in
at varying amounts of interference from zero to
0.010 in. Bushings were chamfered 10 degrees
to enable pressing in Without extruding material
from the lugs. Chamfered ends were ground off
after pressing (see Fig. C13.33)

The points plotted represent an average of

where the lugs were prestressed 48 ksi prior to
testing. Having a stress concentration of 3.6,
the 48 ksi nominal net stress caused local
yielding which relieved some of the interference. At the same time; however, beneficial
compressive residual stresses were being accumulated -- that is, they would be compressive if
it were not for the bushings.

Fig. C13.34 compares lives of small lugs
for cycling at 20 ksi gross area stress after
various preloads. These specimens were the
same as used for Fig. CI3.31, except tapered
bolts were used to transmit the load instead of
tapered pins. Here it is seen that life was
increased from about 30,000 cycles to 500,000
cycles where no preloads were present (20 ksi
prestress is same as cycling stress). With 30
ksi prestress (10 ksi above cycling stress)
no apparent change existed with those specimens
having 0.003-inch interference; however, the
non-interference lugs experienced a slight gain.
By the time preloading was up to 40 ksi, there
was practically no difference between specimens
with and without interference. In other words,
the gain in residual compressive stresses
offset the advantages of interference. This
holds true up to prestresses of 50 ksi. Gross
area stresses are used here to simulate structural joints where net areas are hard to determine.

On a percentage basis, because of increased

C13. 5. 7 Combined Rigidity and Residual stress


The object of presenting the effects of
preloading on the life of specimens with interference fasteners is to acquaint the reader
with what might be expected when high loads in
service do essentially the same thing. This
would infer that, if indeed such stresses were
experienced in serVice, the main advantage of
using interference fasteners would be for that
percentage of life conswned prior to encountering the high load. In fact, some airplanes may
never experience a load sufficiently high to
relieve the prestress provided by interference
fasteners. However, most designs have to be
made on the assumption that a high load will
occur fairly early in life; in fact, the test
airplane will undergo such loading, even if
the service airplanes do not. Accordingly,
the designer is contractually obligated to design the airplane to a specific set of test
loads which include loads high enough to cause
local yielding unless special precautions are
followed.


A solution to the problem of interference
relief due to high loading can be visualized by
a recap of approximately what happens. Fig.
C13.36 shows schematic stress cycling at 20 ksi
after preloading as in Fig. C13.34. Here, the
stress cycling for specimens with 0 interference is determined by using the unnotched S-N
curves of Fig. C13.10, using a stress range
(58 ksi in this case) and appropriate stress
ratio to agree With life after preloading. The
58 ksi stress range was found from the original
life for cycling at R = 0, assuming that no
residual stresses were present in the virgin
specimens. A try and fit procedure is then
used as for Steps 4 and 5 of Example Problem
(1) .


Stresses for specimens with 0.003 interference are found by using Smax for the noninterference specimens and determining stress
ratio fi'om the intercept or S-N curve and
appropriate life. It is necessary to interpolate between curves to agree with test life.
The assumption that Smax is the same for specimens with and Without interference could be in
error if the interference alone caused a higher
stress than that caused by loading. However,
such an error would not affect the purpose of
the illustrations .


The schematics in Fig. CI3.36 show a gradual increase in residual compressive stress
with preload increase. This produces an increase in life for those specimens having 0
interference and a decrease in life for those
with 0.003 interference until a low of 86,000
cycles is reached after a 40 ksi preload. The
trend is then reversed where both types experience gains in life. Presumably, the benefits

Fig. C13.35 - Effect of static prestress upon percentage

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-904-full.png)

interference should have disappeared with the
50 ksi preload; however, some benefit might be
due ta the lqteral constraint afforded by the
interference fit. In any event, the difference in life is sufficiently small to discount
any improvement due to interference.


Considering now the residual stress of
-36 ksi in Fig. C13.36 (d), the 50 ksi preload
could probably be reapplied without a change in
residual stress. Also, it would appear that
the -36 ksi could have been introduced by coining or other methods prior to installation of
the interference fit fastener. This would mean
that a structure fabricated in such a manner
could withstand high loads encountered in service without experiencing a lowering of subsequent life.


Not only would the pre-coined interference
fastener type construction provide relief from
the damage done by overstressing, but the
actual life would be increased. Using the S-N
curves of Fig. C13.10, consider a case Where a


" "



C13.21


structure fails after 11,000 cycles when loaded
at R = 0. From the S-N curves, it appears as
though the actual stress at the concentration
must have been about 70 ksi (see 11,000 cycles
and R = 0). Were it possible to use an interference type fastener at the location of failure such that the actual stress cycle was at
R - +0.5, the life would be increased to 60,000
cycles.


Instead of using an interference fastener,
suppose that the part were coined to produce a
residual compressive stress of -35 ksi. The
stress for the same load condition then would
be ~ 35 ksi (still a range of 70 ksi) which
would result in a life of 55,000 cycles, Which
is no improvement over just using an interference fastener.


However, if the part were coined in addition to using an interference fastener, the
life would be about 700,000 cycles as found in
Fig. C13.10 for stressing at 35 ksi and R = 0.
In this case, the -35 ksi due to coining is

Static and fatigue properties were discussed above to illustrate the effect of residual compressive stressGs, added rigidity, and
combinations of residual stress and rigidity.
The discussion on rigidity covered the effects
of torqued bolts and interference fasteners.


In the case of torqued bolts it was shown
that pre-stress introduced by torquing enables
bolts to employ the extra stiffness or rigidity
afforded by abutting material. Although interference creates peripheral tensile stresses at
the edge of a hole, it is beneficial because
the extra stiffness afforded by the fastener
reduces stress amplitude.


Coining was described as a method of introducing favorable residual stresses. While
coining is usually thought of as a sort of ring
staking, other methods such as burnishing inside of holes by mandrel operation, would not
apply to tapered holes -- at least at the present state-of-the-art. To achieve the benefits
anticipated by the foregoing, a method for
achieving interference with straight fasteners
or a method of coining tapered holes is needed.


One method for coining a tapered hole
would be to over-drive a tapered mandrel to
achieve given amounts of permanent set prior to
installation in a normal manner. At present,
this is not a common practice.


Until recently there has been no fastener
specifically designed to introduce residual
compressive stresses. A cross section of a
newly developed fastener is shown in Fig.
C13.38.(32) The fastener is squeezed or bucked
more or less like a conventional rivet; however,
the head is embedded flush with the surface.



The special feature is a lip around the periphery of the head, which coins the hole as the
fastener is embedded into the material, displaced material flows into the annular groove
under the head and along the reduced section of
the shank, thus making the fastener head and
material being fastened an integral part of the
structure. This reduces hole deformation more
or less as though a staple were driven across
the hole (more on this later). Corresponding
stress reduction is not known at the present
time; however, fatigue data indicate that the
combination of coining, load transfer, and interference fit contribute sUbstantially to
fatigue life increase. Interference is attained
by fastener swelling and by flow of metal toward
the shank as a result of coining.

with aluminum rivets, tapered bolts, and Stress
Pins* are shown in Fig. C13.39. Here we see
that a substantial increase in life is shown by
using Stress Pins except for the extreme higher
load levels. It is of interest to note that the
curves for specimens with tapered bolts and
those with alu~inum rivets appear to converge at
the lower load levels. The reason for this is
that the interference used for specimens with

tapered bolts actually raised the stress at low
load levels; however, it will be shown later
that proportion of damage in this area is small
as compared to that experienced at higher load
levels (see Sec. C13.6). A lower interference
would raise the life at low loads and reduce
life at high loads with the net result of reducing service life--service life being a
function of all load types. Had the interference been lower, the curve for specimens with
tapered bolts would probably fall about midway
between the curves for specimens with rivets
and with Stress Pins.


A word about the one-and-one-half dogbone
specimen shown in Fig. C13.40. The object of
the particular configuration was to simulate
the spar-to-skin attachment of an airplane wing
wherein about 50% of the axial stress in the
skin is due to the load transferred from the
web through the fasteners. Strain gage measurements, however, revealed that but 40% of the
load was transferred from the half dogbone
(representing the web) to the full dogbone in
the case of specimens with tapered bolts and
those with stress Pins. Transfer for specimens
with aluminum alloy rivets was 26%. The
special advantage of using such a specimen is
that but one fastener is needed per specimen.
A complete description of the specimen is given
in Ref. 32.

_C13._ 5. 8 Load Relief at Fasteners


So far, we have discussed methods of
"living with" the stress at a concentration.
A better way is to reduce the stress if it can
be done without increasing weight. Following
are methods which have been proven and add
little if any weight--sometimes weight is reduced.


Redistribution of Load


In most mechanically fastened joints,
stress concentrations fall somewhere between
those for open holes and those for pin-loaded
holes. This stems from the fact that these
joints (except for lugs) usually incorporate
more than one fastener. In these cases, the
load is not equally divided between fasteners

Fig. _C13.42_ - Improved load distribution is had by scarfing.

and the fastener nearest source of load introduces stresses more like those in the pinloaded hole as shown in Fig. CI3.3. Fig. C13.4l
shows the load distribution in a four-fastener
clevis joint.(33) Here the amount of stress is
demonstrated by the number of photoelastic
fringes at each of the fasteners. Scarfing the
jOint reduces the stress at the first fastener
as shown in Fig. CI3.42. However, scarfing is
not very practical from a fabrication point.
A similar effect can be had by using an auxiliary thin doubler(34) that picks up one fastener
nearest source of load. The thin doubler is
incapable of carrying more than its share of
load. Adjustments would have to be made for
static strength because of bearing strength in
the thin doubler; however, an easy method is
simply to assume that the fastener through the
thin doubler carries no load. A comparison of
the fatigue lives of conventional joints and
joints with auxiliary thin doublers is shown in
Fig. CI3.43.



become common practice to machine material away
from low-stressed areas to reduce weight,
leaving fUll-thickness material at splices.
Thus entire airplane wing skins might be
machined except for the raised lands in splices
and other critical areas.

Fig. C13.43 - Effect of auxiliary thin doubler on fatigue
strength of 2024-T3 aluminum alloy singleshear butt joints.


Separate Axial from Bending Stresses

Since airplane structures employ singleshear joints because of aerodynamic smoothness,
bending stresses are added to the stresses due
to load transfer in the joint. This is illustrated in the single-shear butt joint shown in
Fig. C13.44 where a rivet driven through the
edge of the doubler causes it to last 5 times
as long. Here, the edge-driven rivet is incapable of carrying other than a clamping force,
leaving the loaded rivets free of bending
stresses. (34) The nested angle specimens were
designed to eliminate as much bending as possible without the aid of edge-driven rivets. The
effect of bending is even more pronounced in
lap joints. Because of thiS, lap joints should
be avoided wherever possible except where
stresses are extremely low.


Sculptured Skins


With the advent of profile milling, it has

Fig. CI3.44 - Edge driven rivet improves fatigue strength of
single-shear butt joints.


While it is never possible to achieve a
situation where the structure away from the
splice is completely free of concentrations, the
thickened lands in the splice area permit working the remaining areas to higher stresses than
would be possible by other means.


Since the raised lands involve fillets at
the juncture of machined skin and parent material, there could be a situation wherein the
stress at the fillet is worse than at the fastener holes being protected. This comes about
by virtue of the single-shear attachment of a
flush joint, introducing bending stresses that
are exaggerated by the increase in moment arm
separating the centroids of skin and doubler
when the land thickness is increased. Furthermore, as load is increased, a certain amount of
alignment takes place so that the ratio of bending to axial stress is not proportional to load.
Accordingly, the effect of stress concentration
at fillets is load related and has to be considered in the design of the structure.


A typical example is a single-shear butt
joint having equal thickness skin and doubler.
Here, the bending stress alone turns out to be
3 PIA at the time P ~ O. When the load is increased, the skin and doubler tend to align
themselves so that eventually an increase in
load does not increase stress due to bending.
Certainly, by the time the entire cross-sectional area has yielded, the stress can be assumed
to be PIA even though a substantial difference
exists in strains due to bending. Fig. C13.45
presents stress-corrected concentration factors
for a 7075-T6 aluminum alloy joint having equal
land and doubler thickness. (36) These curves
were obtained by multiplying the ratio of calculated bending stress/axial stress times the

concentration factors s~own in Fig. C13.46.

From the foregoing, an even larger radius
would further reduce the stress. However,
there are times when there is no room to permit
using a radius sufficiently large to reduce the
stress the required amount. In such cases, a
variable radius that is generated by inter


CI3.25


sections of straight lines as shown in Fig.
C13.47 will lower the stress.(37) However, if
space permits, an even greater reduction in
stress can be had by using unequally spaced
divisions on the vertical and horizontal axes
as shown in Fig. C13.48.

From the above, it would appear that even
With lands, the effect of stress concentrations
cannot be entirely eliminated. This is particUlarly true for spanwise lands where the stress
is directly proportional to the wing depth and
radius of curvature of the deflected wing. Unless local reinforcing reduces the curvature,
the bending stress will not be reduced. This
usually is the case because local increase in
thickness over spar attachemnts adds little to
total wing moment of inertia.


This concept is more easily understood by
visualizing the stresses in a bar like that
shown in Fig. C13.49a. With the bar stressed
in tension, the strain is defined as elongation

ThUS, we have the case of the skin having
the same stretch whether or not spanwise lands
are added. In such cases, the stress at fastener holes cannot be cut in half by doubling skin
thickness with lands as one might first suspect.
However, lands do provide extra bearing area
which permit using countersunk fasteners that
might otherwise leave sharp edges instead of
bearing surfaces. Unless material is removed
from the lands between holes, the axial component of stress will be exactly the same. In
other words, we have to force the material in
areas away from the concentration to deform
more in order to reduce deformation at holes.


The above illustrates a basic principle
that shOUld be followed in all designs--STRESS



AT A CONCENTRATION CAN BE REDUCED BY REMOVING
MATERIAL AWAY FROM THE CONCENTRATION. Thus in
the case of the auxiliary doubler (Ref. Fig.
C13.43), the same effect could have been
attained by removing material from the doubler
between the first and second rows of fasteners.
In the case of the improved fillets (Ref. Fig.
C13.47) we see that materl.al can be removed to
reduce the stress.


C13.6 CUMULATIVE FATIGUE DAMAGE


C13. 6.1 Introduction


We have seen that the life of a structure
or a specimen can be represented by S-N or
Load-N curves when cycling at constant amplitUde. However, in service, a random mixture of
loads occur at each flight with no one flight
being exactly like another.


Not only does each flight vary, but aerospace structures have different required lives
in terms of usage over a time interval. Examples of what flight vehicles are expected to
endure are given in Table 111(38). Here it is
seen that lives can vary from 20 years to but
a minute or so, the twenty-year life for commercial aircraft being interpreted as 50,000
hours of flight. This means the manufacturer
has to demonstrate by design and test that the
structure will withstand loads whose cumUlative
effects are equivalent to 50,000 hours of
flight. Military airplanes have expected lives
of from 3000 hours for a fighter to 30,000
hours for a trainer.


CI3.6.2 Loads


Flight data are usually obtained by means
of counting accelerometers located near the
G.G. of the airplane and such information is
then plotted in the form of ogive curves as
shown for gust loading in Fig. C13.50(39).
In addition, maneuver, ground-air-ground
(G.A.G.), landing, and taxi loads are added to

make the complete load spectrum.


Actual loads for design purposes, being
related to speed, aerodynamic, rigidity, and
various other properties of a given airplane,
are usually specified by agreement with the
contacting agency. Since loads for a particular
airplane are largely due to the type of operation and flight paths contemplated, it is
usually common to use a set of conditions which
will involve the more critical of a fleet of
airplanes. Despite this, one airlines operator
may experience fatigue proglems while another,
using the same make of airplane, may experience
no difficulties whatsoever. In any event, the
designer has to design a structure which will
pass a simulated service loads test for a required number of equivalent hours.

In general, fighter airplanes are more
critical in maneuver and landing conditions
than for gust. Transport airplanes, on the
other hand, are more critical for gust loading.
Table IV(40) shows maneuver load spectrums
for various military airplane where Fighters,
Patrol, Utility, and Transport airplanes fall
into classes A, B, C, and D, respectively.

The loads used for design and test may not
reflect actual loads in service in that compromises are usually made such that the most
critical of one flight condition is blended
With other critical conditions to end up With a
composite of all conditions.



NOTE: Above load factors are considered to
vary from unity to each specified maneuver
load factor to unity again for each occur
rence.


While the above loads to not include gust,
landing, nor taxiing loads, they will serve
for the illustrative problems to follow. It
should be noted that effects of gusts are
largely dependent on individual characteristics
of a given airplane. A conversion of gust
velocities (Ref. Fig. C13.50) to load factors,
while suitable for the individual airplane concerned, might be misleading for other airplanes


The loads in Table IV, while seemingly
severe, justify themselves in that airplanes
which successfully passed fatigue tests using
such spectra have given but few fatigue problems, while those using less severe loading
have given numerous problems, notwithstanding
the fact that all airplanes met the same
static requirements.


One problem lies in when the highest load
in the spectrum occurs. Early applications of


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-911-full.png)

C13.28 FATIGUE



high loads may either increase life or lower it.
This will be discussed in C13.6.4.


C13. 6. 3 Predicting Life


Cumulative fatigue damage may be defined
as a degradation due to repeated stressing
which is additive with each cycle. If an airplane were critical only at but one point, and
no residual stress or fastener loosening due to
high loading influenced subsequent life, then,
supposedly if 50% of life were spent at one
load level, there should be 50% of life remaining which could be spent at any load or mixture
of loads before failure occurs.


First proposed by Palmgren in 1923(41), a
method for adding fractional damages had not
come into general usage until a paper by Milton
Miner (42) presented considerable data that substantiated the method.


In general, the method proposes that if a
structure were to fail after N1 cycles for
loading at a stress S1, N2 cycles at a stress
of S2 and Nn cycles at a stress corresponding
to Sn, then that structure would fail when
Z n/N = 1, where n1, n1, and nn are partial
lives spend at their respective stress levels.


Since the method is still being used
throughout industry and various services, ex


amples of how to use the method will be presented here. However, the reader must bear in
mind that, While being a method still accepted,
that consideration needs to be made regarding
the type of structure involved. While the
method is usually conservative for cases involving open notches (open holes, fillet radii,
etc.), structures having rivet filled holes or
employing interference-fit fasteners have to be
critically examined to determine whether the
highest load in the spectrum enhances or is
detrimental to subsequent performance at lower
stresses. As shown by effects or preloading on
lugs (Ref. Fig. C13.34), more than half the
anticipated life can be lost when preloading is
such as to loosen the fastener.


Consider a 4000-hour fighter airplane
whose limit stress is 30 ksi based on gross
area. From Table IV, we first compute the
stresses corresponding to the specified loads.
For simplification, let us consider that loading
is with respect to zero instead of IG and omit
the negative loads on the assumption that the
extension of each load cycle to zero will produce damage equivalent to the loads omitted.


Assume further that the eqUivalent stress
concentration factor for the structure is 3.1
based on gross area. This enables us to use an
S-N curve for hole-notched speciments for loading at R - 0 (Ref. Fig. C13.51). Now we simply

To allow for a scatter factor of 4, the
calculated life should be 16,000 hours. Accordingly, our assumption of a 30 ksi limit
stress was too high, assuming that the stress
cannot be reduced by reducing the stress concentration. The problem now is to "guess" the
stress reduction needed. For the time being,
let us assume that the reduction in stress at
limit load would be proportional to lives of
notched specimens for a stress at a lifetime
which is 16,000/8,876 greater than the life corresponding to the limit stress of 30 ksi, 20,000
cycles in this case. Accordingly, we have
1.802 x 20,000 = 36,040 cycles whose corresponding maximum stress tur~s out to be 27.0 ksi.
Using the same procedure as shown in Table V, we
determine the life to be about 21,000 hours.
Successive calculations for limit stresses of
28 ksi and 29 ksi yielded lives of 17,000 and
13,000 hours. Plotting limit stresses vs. calculated hours of flight, we have a straight line
as shown in Fig. C13.52. From this we interpolate the allowable stress at limit load to be
28.3 ksi.


While the above computations imply a greater accuracy than is justified by the source of
data, we have to work to something and that is
the reason for the scatter factor requirement in
design. Depending on the contracting agency,
the airplane When finally built will have to
undergo simulated service loading for an equivalent of 4 lifetimes. While it can hardly be
expected that the test will be completed without
some failures, minor though they may be, the
designer should be cognizant of what the



C13.29


penalties might be should an early failure occur. Penalties as used here refers to costs of
rectifying deficiencies and loss of time. Accordingly, it behooves the designer to be more
conservative in the design of a wing spar than
for replaceable parts, such as hinge brackets.

Fig. C13.52 Stress at limit load vs. valculated hours of flight
(Ref. Table IV, Spectrum A, positive loads only)


In the above, we assumed Kt = 3.1 because
of available test data. However, many airplane
parts have concentrations far in excess of 3.1
While some may be lower. Having plotted limit
stress vs. life as in the above, we are now in
a position to estimate life for any stress concentration. For example, had the stress concentration been 4.0 instead of 3.1, we would
simply lower the design stress by the ratio of
4.0/3.1.


Whether or not the design stresses, as
plotted above, fallon a straight line depends
largely on the load spectrum. However, whatever the spectrum, plotting computed lives as
shown will enable the designer to visualize

two highest loads in a spectrum can greaty
influence spectrum life, particularly for specimens using tapered bolts. Here it is seen that
deleting the two highest loads increased life of
specimens With tapered bolts by more than 4
times, While the same deletion reduced life of
specimens with conventional fasteners. Specimens

removal of any load whatsoever would increase
life. However, referring to residual stresses
gained by overloading (Ref. Fig. C13.20), the
above results are not surprising. However,
this does point to the extreme care needed in
anticipating the effects of high loading on a
structure before attempting to predict fatigue
life.


While it is not so easy to anticipate effects of high loads on structures using interference fasteners, if we consider a driven
rivet as an interference fit fastener, we see
in Fig. C13.54 that preloading can have the
effect of both, reducing fatigue life, and
again increasing life. Here riveted joints

fasteners. Test spectra given in Table VI, are
roughly the same as for Spectrum A in Table IV.


The loading in the above is less conservative than used in Table V in that loads were
not complete removed. However, for comparative
purposes they are adequate. Referring to the
total damage of 0.11266 given in Table V, we
see that the two highest loads contributed but
4.5% of the total damage. Yet removal of
equivalent loads in the above resulted in a loss
of life for those specimens having conventional
fasteners. Intuitively, we should think that

were tested after varying preload conditions. (43)
The center graph is the case where no preload
is imposed and is the S-N curve normally used
for estimating fatigue cwnulative damage. The
lower curve, the one we should be concerned
with, represents specimens which were preloaded
18 ksi prior to testing. The average life is
reduced to about 1/4 of the original. However,
referring to Table V, we see that most of the
damage is done in the 50,000 - 350,000 cycle
life range (see lives for 65, 75, and 85 percent loading) where the average life (for
riveted joints shown in Fig. C13.54) is reduced
to about one-third of the original.


Had we used the middle curve for our
previous calculations and then subjected the
structure to a spectrum load test wherein 18 ksi
was the highest load in the spectrum, we should
have fell short of the design life by a factor
of 3. On the other hand, had the highest load
been 25 ksi (shown by triangles in the graph),
the test life would have fell short by not more
than 25%. Had the highest load been 42 ksi,
the life would have exceeded calculated values
by more than ten times.


In view of the wide discrepancies in
fatigue life caused by stress interaction, we
have now reached a point Where an S-N curve for
a complete structure or structural component
appears only remotely related to its spectrum
life. While most of the discrepancies can be
definitely related to gains in residual stresses
or loosening of fasteners, other factors such as
fretting and corrosion have not been taken into
account.


C13. 6. 5 Fatigue Strength Index **--** An Easy Out


In the days of static designs, the limit
load was supposed to be one which would never
be exceeded during the lifetime of an airplane.
Accordingly, some of the earliest fatIgue tests
were made using repeated limit loads Wherein it
was believed that 3000 - 4000 cycles were ample
for any fatigue requirement. Referring to Figs.
C13.52 and again to Fig. C13.51, we see that
the calculated design limit stress of 28.3 ksi
corresponds to a life of between 25,000 and
30,000 cycles. Accordingly, were we to design
to this partIcular spectrwn, why not simply
design to a life of 30,000 cycles and not
bother With trying to estimate cumulative damage?


While such a design is no guarantee that
the structure will pass a spectrum load test,
unless it could Withstand 30,000 cycles of limit
load, its chances of passing a spectrum test
would be remote. This applies to the one particular spectrum; however, there should be some
life (fatigue strength index) at limit loading
which corresponds to an approprIate life for any
given spectrum.



Cl3.31


The choice of limit stress is used here
because it is convenient in that it is a reference for static designs. Moreover, the
stress should be high enough to impose Whatever gains in residual stress or loosening of
fasteners that might occur in service.


In 1963 (Ref. 7) the author introduced
a method for predictIng fatigue life of structures for service loading. It incorporated
effects of residual stress resulting from the
highest load in the spectrum. Prorating the
stress ranges (including residual stress) due
to limit loading with other loads in the

spectr~~, a good correlation between life at
limit load and spectrum life was established
for full-scale structures; however, the method
was slightly unconservative for small specimens. Notwithstanding the discrepancies, a
number of tests on small specimens did confirm
the relation between constant-amplitude life
at limit loading and spectrum life -- at least
Where conventional fasteners were used.

Test results are shown in Fig. C13.55.
Here we see that the theoretical curve and
graph for single-shear butt joints would intersect at a constant-amplitude life of 30,000
cycles, in which case the design and actual
life would concur. The curve for specimens
with tapered bolts does not behave in a like
manner, however. As might be expected from
their behavior in Fig. C13.53, they are very
sensitive to high loads in a spectrum. Also,

life is not because their spectrum life was
lower, but that spectrum life in relation to
their own constant-amplitude lives was lower.
Note that the graphs are constant-amplitude life
vs. spectrum life.


Constant-amplitude life vs. spectrum life
for fUll-scale structures is presented in Fig.
C13.56. Here we have excellent agreement between calculated and test lives. The calculations in this particular case involved using
the life of the structure for limit loading in
conjunction with a stress-strain curve for the
material and S-N curves from Fig. C13.l0 which
are replotted in Fig. C13.57 to include a maximum stress cutoff line.


Here, it is assumed that the maximum stress
at a concentration involves plastic deformation
if life is fewer than 10,000 cycles. The slope
of the cutoff line is determined by a point
representing 3 % strain at R = 0.9 - and the
yield strength of the material at R = 0.5


R = 0.9 was chosen as a limiting value for residual compressive stress because of Bauschinger effects, which lowers
compressive yield after once yielding in tension. The 3%
strain conforms with a stress concentration of 4 times O. 75
(strain at 0.2% offset). Higher straining would supposedly

and being faired in to intercept the curve for
R = 0 at 72 ksi (proportional limit). In essence, it is a mirror image of the stressstrain curve.


Accordingly, if an airplane or component
fails after fewer than 10,000 cycles when subjected to tension-tension constant-amplitude
loading, the maximum stress at the point of
failure is found at the intercept of life with
the cutoff line. The minimum stress, by definition, is the maximum stress times whatever R
curve exists at the intercept.


Knowing the maximum stress and minimum
stress, we have the total stress range which
can be prorated for any other load in a spectrum. Note that we do not even have to know
the nominal stress nor stress concentration.


NUMERICAL EXAMPLE


Consider a structure which is cycled at
R = 0 and which fails after 1000 cycles of limit
load. How long will a similar structure last
when loaded according to the following spectrum?

Referring to Fig. C13.57, we find that the
maximum stress at the cutoff line corresponding
with a life of 1000 cycles is 77 ksi and that
the intercept is at R = 0.76 (using interpolated
values). See sketch below.

Using the stress range of 135 ksi, we can now
compute the stress range for other loads in the
spectrum.

100 135.5
85 115.2
70 94.8
55 74.5
40 54.2


Since the order of loading shows that 3 cycles
of 100 percent were applied first, the residual stress of 58.5 ksi will remain throughout remaining load steps. The residual stress
is then to be sUbtracted from the stress range
to find maximum stresses at other loads.


Load - Stress Minimum Maximum
% Limit Range Stress Stress


100 135.5 -58.5 77.0
85 115.2 56.7

70 94.8 ! 36.3
55 74.5 -58.5 16.0


We now have the maximum and minimum stress for
each load step. By dividing the minimum stress
by the maximum stress, we obtain the stress
ratio (R) and find corresponding lives _(N)_ from
the S-N curves in Fig. C13.57. Knowing the
number of cycles per step (n) in each sequence,
the proportion of damage is found by dividing
n by N. The structure will fail (according to
the Miner rule) when ~ _nlN_ = 1. The work is
simplified by arranging all steps as in the
following table:

While the Smith method is used in some aircraft companies and by the Navy, unless computer
programmed, the calculations are tedious and
probably not necessary. The purpose of showing
roughly how the Smith method works is to acquaint
the reader with how the relation between constant-amplitude life at limit load and spectrum
life came about (Ref. Fig. C13.56), in fact, that
there is a relation at all .. While someone in
an organization will need to compute the appropriate constant-amplitude life for an individual aircraft, the designer need not go through

the life at limit loading for assurance that
the structure will have a good chance of passing
the spectrum test.


As previously indicated, life predictions
can be so spadmodic that the effort is seldom
really necessary. As an example of predictions
and test results on fUll-scale airplane structures, Table VII(44) shows predictions and test
results where predictions, except one, were
made by the linear or Miner rule. The one exception (2nd item from top) was predicted by
the Smith method.


C13. 6. 6 Summary on Life Production


In view of the discrepancies shown in
Table VII between predicted and test lives, we
have reached a point where any prediction seems
futile. Perhaps we have overlooked the need
for designing a structure that will not fail,
rather than trying to predict how long it will
last. As shown in C13.5, there are means of
increasing life to where an estimate of fatigue
life becomes unnecessary inasmuch as static
strength will design the part.


However, since a fatigue analysis is
frequently a part of a contractual obligation,
and the Miner method is an accepted way, the
simple integration of lives from S-N curves
(Ref. C13.6.3) supposedly having the same



stress concentration factor as the structure
will fill contractual obligations. However, a
fUll-scale test is also a contractual obligation, so that whatever analysis is made, the
final proof will lie in withstanding the reqUired simulated service tests.


If there is doubt whether the structure
will meet the required tests, and the stress
concentration is known, one can simply multiply
the nominal stress at limit load times the
stress concentration to obtain stress range.
Having the stress range, if more than 70 ksi,
the residual stress may be found from Fig.
C13.58. The difference between residual stress
and stress range is the maximum stress. Stress
ratio, R, is obtained by dividing residual
stress by maximum stress and appropriate lives
can be found from the S-N curves shown in Fig.
C13.57, using the same procedure as outlined in
the numerical exa~ple to estimate cumulative
damage.


Since it would be impossible to introduce
a greater residual stress than the compressive
yield strength of the material (71 ksi for
7075-T6), an arbitrary cutoff of about 69 ksi
is shown in Fig. C13.58. This is more of academic interest than of practical value, since a
structure having a service load that introduces
more than 69 ksi residual stress is unlikely to
be satisfactory in any event.

Finally, there is no positive way of predicting service life; however, the use of unnotched specimen data with appropriate stress
concentrations will come closer than any
method so far devised. The reason for this is
that much of the published notched data include
hidden residual stresses due to specimen fabrication which lead to unconservative estimates
(see C13.3.2).


The above applies to 7075-T6 only. For
estimating life of other materials, use the
unnotched data shown in the appendix. Such
data should be plotted as in Fig. C13.58, using
a stress-strain curve for the material to
establish the cutoff line.


_C13.7_ SAFE LIFE, FAIL SLOW, AND FAIL SAFE


_C13._ 7.1 Safe Life and Crack Propagation


So far we have discussed methods of increasing life and of estimating life. A
structure whose only claim to reliability is
through analysis and simulated service fatigue
tests is called "safe life". Such a structure
is definitely limited to the flying hours to
which the airplane was certified.


The single' spar Viscount is an example of
a safe life airplane. Needless to say, careful analysis and thorough testing is needed in
such cases. However, even with single spar
construction, inspection procedures are usually
such that a fatigue crack can be detected long
before it becomes critical. Crack growth at
critical sections is measured during the fatigue
test so that airplanes in service having similar
cracks usually have ample warning before anything like catastrophic failures occur. Recent



_C13.35_


studies in fracture mechanics have disclosed
methods of estimating crack tolerance for many
situations.


Generally, thin skins are less susceptible
to catastrophic failures due to fatigue cracks
than thick-skins. Accordingly, commercial airlines have standard policies for thin skins as
to length of crack permissible before repairs
are needed. The usual procedure for such repairs is to stop-drill (drill a hole at the
end of a crack) the crack and patch the skin
With a patch of equal thickness material. Unfortunately, such repairs are of short duration
in that the crack eventually progresses through
the crack-stop hole and out from under the
patch. It is commonly believed that this is
because the crack-stop hole did not actually
encompass the end of the crack.


Grover(45) considers' crack growth to be in
four stages. The first is simply initiation,
second is the first stage of growth, third is a
steady growth stage (the one usually measured
in propagation studies), and finally a stage of
rapid propagation. The total time between
stages depends on stress; however, the ratios
between the stages is about the same for all
stress levels where loading is constant-amplitude. A high load in a spectrum will cause
local yielding and result in a retardation for
a short period at SUbsequent lower loads.


Fig. C13.59 (graph a) shows a typical crack
growth graph for an 8-inch wide sheet of 7075-T6
aluminum alloy in which cracks were aided in
starting by drilling a small hole in the center
and notching edges of the hole With a jeweler's
saw. Measurements were made after the crack
had been allowed to grow to 0.037-inch. Cycled
at 20 ksi gross stress, R = 0.1, final failure
did not occur until after 41,000 cycles. This
represents 3/4 of the total life; however, it
must be remembered that the crack generated in
the first 10,000 cycles was aided by the superimposed stress concentrations. Had the specimen simply been hole-notched (Ref. Fig. C13.12),
the first crack should not have appeared until
more than 100,000 cycles had been sustained.
Accordingly, had this been representative of a
structure, roughly 25% of life was spent in
propagation of the crack.


To determine the effectiveness of stopcrack holes, a second experiment was made wherein 3/16-inch diameter holes were drilled at the
ends of the crack. The specimen lasted for
51,000 cycles (see Fig. C13.59, graph b) or an
extension of 20% in total life. Two additional
experiments were made wherein a Stress Pin (Ref.
Fig. C13.38) was driven in the crack-stop hole,
and a second wherein the crack was permitted to
grow 3/8-inch after which a Stress Pin was inserted in such a manner that 1/16-inch of crack

extended beyond the fastener head to simulate
the case where the crack-stop hole missed the
end of the crack. These are shown in graphs (c)
and (d) of Fig. C13.59. Here it is seen that
an increase in life of more than 5 times is
achieved by using the fastener in the crackstop hole. The reason for this is that the outstanding flanges _at_ the fastener act as a bridge
for load to be carried across the crack, more or
less as though a staple were driven across the
crack.


C13. 7.2 Fail Safe


Having no positive way of guaranteeing that
a structure might not fail before its so-called
guaranteed lifetime, it is now common practice
to provide mUltiple load paths so that should
anyone of a number of load carrying members
fail, the airplane is still able to carry a
guaranteed percentage of the design limit load
without failure. Thus, a wing having five spars
could lose one spar entirely and still carry
SO% of the original design load. This is
figuratively speaking, since, depending on which
of the 5 spars failed, the torsional resistance
could not be proportional to the number of
spars.


A system of having fail-safe lugs is to
have them laminated so that one of the laminates



can fail without effecting the strength of the
remainder. This is somewhat different from
the fail-slow idea of allowing a crack to
progress a given depth, say the thickness of
one laminate, where fracture toughness would be
the governing feature. In other words, the
strength of the remaining area in a cracked lug
is only a fraction of its rated PIA value.
This is also true of cracked skins, however,
the thin skin has a greater fracture toughness
than thick plates. Wilhelm(46) shows skins
having thickness of less than 0.15-inch to be
2.4 times as tough as When thickness is more
than O.SO-inch.


The use of stiffener and skin combinations
adds to an airplane's fail-safe integrity. Not
only does it provide multiple load paths, but
the stringers act as crack arrestors. That is,
a crack will progress to a stringer and cease
to propagate for a period before continuing to
the next stringer. This is fail-slow rather
than fail-safe. In any event, it permits time
to make repairs before the crack becomes
dangerous.


Integral fuel tanks are, in a way, fail
safe features. This stems from the fact that
fuel leaks will reveal cracks long before
being detected by conventional inspection
processes.


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-920-full.png)

Although the slow propagation of cracks
constitutes a fail-safe measure in a way, no
airlines operator can afford to spend much time
in repairing cracks. This is not only because
of repair costs in themselves, but down time
for the airplane. The daily interest on a 7million dollar airplane not being used, assuming 6% rate, is $1,150 per day. Thus we see
that prevention of cracks is most important,
even if no fail-safe feature were involved.


_C13.8_ FREQUENTLY OVERLOOKED PROBLEM AREAS


_C13.8.1_ Fatigue Failures of Compressive Surfaces


While an airplane structure has to be
designed to both fatigue and static requirements, the usual practice is to design to static
strength and then do whatever is needed to
bring the structure up to fatigue strength.
Because of fatigue problems, however, the recent
trend is to use a lower strength material
(2024-T3) for wing lower surfaces, tail surfaces, and fuselage structures. 2024-T3 (or
T851) has a slower crack propagation rate than
7075 alloys--also higher brittle fracture
toughness.


Upper surfaces, and other members loaded
primarily in compression are usually designed
of 7075-T6 or 2014-T6 material because of their
high compressive yield strengths. However,
because loading is primarily in compression
does not exempt a structure from fatigue problems. A fatigue crack in a wing upper surface
may come as a surprise because tension stresses
due to negative maneuvers, gust, or landing
conditions are usually much less than corresponding stresses in the lower surface. What
happens is that a high positive load can yield
the material at a concentration in compression
so as to introduce a residual tension stress
(just the reverse of examples shown in tension)
so that the stress at the concentration suffers
a tensile stress every time the structure is
unloaded.


Eventually, a fatigue crack develops and
progresses until the area of the crack is
sufficient to carry the compressive load without further yielding. FrcJln then on, only the
negative loads will increase crack length;
however, because of brittle fracture characteristics, such a structure becomes dangerous for
negative loading, however small such loads
might be. Thus, a fatigue test having only
positive loads may not reveal the fault, nor
will the analysis unless consideration is given
to residual stresses.


Failures in compressi ve ill rfaces usually
occur at fillets, fastener holes, or at corners
of access doors. A correction is to use
generous fillets (see Figs. C13.4P - 48) or to



_C13.37_


have fastener holes completely filled. While
an interference fit is best we presently have
no interference-fit fasteners which are satisfactory for removable panels. In thick skins,
it is possible to use countersunk fasteners
with a steep bevel (60 [0] instead of 100 [0 ] ) so
that when installed the fastener head can carry
the compressive load required Without permitting
plastic flow at the hole.


Where skin is too thin to permit a 60 [0]
countersink and it is not possible to use an
interference fit fastener, the following should
be used as a gUideline for maximum allowable
clearance. Since it takes but 0.006 in. in
strain (proportional limit) to cause plastic
deformation in 7075 or 2014 alloys, and the
concentration factor for a hole in a wide sheet
is 3, it follows that the maximum clearance for
a I-inch diameter bolt would be 0.OOG/3 = 0.002inch before risking compressive plastic flow at
the hole. By the same token, a 1/4-inch diameter bolt could have no more than 0.0005-inch
clearance. Should lower strength alloys be
used in compressive surfaces, the tolerance
would have to be reduced in proportion to differences in proportional limits.


_C13._ 8. 2 Heavy Forging Attachments on Stressed Parts


While forgings in themselves are sometimes
fatigue prone in that they are sometimes loaded
in an adverse grain direction, they are frequently attached to highly stressed parts, and,
although supposedly having nothing to do with
the stress pattern in the stressed member, are
catalysts for early fatigue failure. An example of this is a heavy support bracket attached
through a stressed spar web to a wing bulkhead
(see Fig. C13.60). Here, a fatigue crack was
started at a fastener used to attach the forging
to a wing bulkhead; however, it did not permit
the spar web to deform properly with results as
shown.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-921-full.png)

C13.38 FATIGUE



Wherever situations like this arise, a
solution is to feed out the stress through
successive layers of thinner material or to provide gradual taper to the first point of attachment.


If this is not possible, perhaps the heavy
piece could be split normal to the direction of
stress in the spar to permit "breathing room".
To lower the stress fluctuation resulting from
the hole itself, tapered bolts at points of
attachment will help. However, because of
stress corrosion susceptibility of forgings in
the transverse grain direction, the interference should be in the spar web and not in the
forging.

C13. 8. 3 Single Shear Flush Joints


A common fault in designing mechanically
fastened flush type joints is that of using
splice plates which are too thick. This is a
result of designing for static strength where
it is considered a good practice to have
fastener shear, sheet tensile strength, bearing
and tear out all equal. A splice plate which
is equal to or heavier than the material being
spliced overloads the first fastener nearest
load source (See Fig. C13.41) so as to cause
fatigue cracks at the first fastener.


In designing for fatigue, the first
fastener nearest load should be incapable of
carrying a load which will cause the material
being spliced to fail in fatigue. A smaller
diameter fastener is simply to invite trouble
with the fastener itself. A better way is to
thicken the ends of the material being spliced
(sculptured skins) as shown in Fig. C13.61,
using a scarf to afford better load distribution.


Critical areas are in the skin at Fastener
No.1 and in the splice plate at Fastener No.5.
Accordingly, anything we can do to relieve
stress in these locations is beneficial. In
the case of Fastener No.5, we have permitted
the countersink going all the way through the
outer sheet. While this should never be permitted ordinarily, it is one way of assuring
that the splice plate will not fail at this
location. This is particularly important in
that this is the location of maximum bending in



the splice plate and is hidden from view where
fatigue cracks would be hard to detect.


A similar situation exists at Fastener No.
1 where special precaution should be taken to
assure that the shearing strength of the fasteners exceed bearing strength in the splice plate.
Accordingly, overloading will not loosen the
fastener in the material we are trying to protect. Permanent bearing deformation in the
doubler, if it occurs, is not critical since it
merely relieves loads that cause fatigue.
Fasteners at locations 2, 3, and 4 should be
capable of carrying very nearly the full static
requirement.


C13. 8. 4 Fastener Sizes


A common fault is to use fasteners which
are too small. Remember that the stress concentration for a hole is about the same, whatever the hole size. The larger fastener provides more bearing area, doesn't bend so much,
and has greater installation tolerance (see Fig.
C13.62). Furthermore, the material stack-up
ratio (ratio of fastener diameter/material
thickness) is better when using larger fasteners. Fatigue tests have shown that specimens
having 3-diameter stackup ratios lasted from
1/10 to 1/5 as long as those having ratios of
1 or 2 diameters.


One reason for the trend towards small
fasteners is because of having higher strength
fasteners available. This has resulted in some
weight saving, however, there are probably
better ways of reducing weight than by using
undersize fasteners.

C13. 8. 5 Acoustic Fatigue


While acoustic fatigue is a study all within itself and therefore beyond the scope of the
present section, certain precautions can be


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-922-full.png)

taken where exposure to sonic vibration induced
by jet noises or propeller blasts invite fatigue
problems which are somewhat different from those
caused by aerodynamic loading.


The most common fault in design is that of
using unsymmetrical rib structures where rolling causes cracks to form through the line of
rivets or over the rib web as shown in Fig.
C13.63(a). A correction for this can be made
by adding an angle to make the section more
symmetrical as shown in Fig. C13.63(b); however, an even better solution is to use extruded
T or H sections having rounded flange edges.
The rounded flanges help to prevent cracking the
skin over the edges as in Fig. C13.63(a).


Points of Crack Initiation



C13.39


4. Have high stresses in transverse grain
direction been avoided?


5. Have generous radii been used throughout?


6. How about spotfacing? Have spotface tools
been modified to provide suitable corner
radii ?


7. Are changes in cross section as gradual as
possible? Use streamline fillets where
helpful.


8. How about open holes? It is useless to use
tapered bolts for fatigue enhancement and
leave an open hole in the area for other
purposes. See that appropriate measures
are taken to either plug the hole or use an
interference fit bushing. If this is not
possible material at hole area has to be
thickened.


9. Are joints, parts, fittings, etc., eccentric -- if so, is it possible to design
them otherwise?

Fig. C13.63 - Fatigue critical areas in acoustical environment


A layer of viscoelastic material between
skin and stringers or ribs helps. There have
been cases where known critical areas were
helped by painting inside of skin with fuel
sealing compounds.


Offhand, it would appear that the best
design against accoustical fatigue is to design
parts of such mass and rigidity that they will
be above resonance frequencies of the system.
However, this is virtually impossible as the
whole spectrum of frequencies is experienced
during engine runup and takeoff. Fortunately,
the duration at each frequency is very short.
However, stresses can be reduced by using
appropriate damping materials.


C 13.9 Check List


1. Has proper surface finish been specified?
125 r.m.s. or better in general with 60 or
smoother at concentrations.


2. Have machined mismatches been avoided?
SpeCify hand finishing if needed to blend
machined surfaces at changes of section.


3. Has shot peening in critical areas been
specified? Consult design manuals or get
help regarding appropriate processes to

use.



11. Where hard plating has been used, has shot
peening been specified to compensate for
loss in fatigue strength?


12. How about anodic coating? Hard coatings
(sulphuric acid) are vulnerable to fatigue
cracking--use chromic acid or soft anodize.


13. Stress corrosion? Have sUitable precautions
been taken to prevent sustained stresses in
short transverse grain direction?


14. Has each joint been examined to make sure
that the first fastener nearest load carries
less load than remaining fasteners?
Splicing material at first fastener should
be thin enough to assure bearing failure
before fastener shears (see Fig. C13.8.3).


15. Has access been provided for inspection of
fatigue critical areas?


C13.10 Concluding Remarks


While it was impOSSible to cover more than
the most rUdimentary facets of fatigue in the
foregoing, it is hoped that the reader will use
the material in the references to further his
ability to foresee and correct fatigue problem

areas.


While fatigue has not, as of this writing,
moved to a position Where structures are designed for fatigue resistance rather than for static


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-923-full.png)

CI3.40 FATIGUE



strength, it would appear futile to design to
the last ounce of weight for static considerations and not consider fatigue. This is why
we have experienced so many fatigue problems
to date. It is not that we are designing to
excessive stresses so much as we are not taking
pains to see that the stress has proper distribution.


We have tried to consider many of the
possibilities which confront the deffigner;
however, these were confined to those normally
found in airplane structures. Some of the
points not covered are: low cycle fatigue,
strain cycling, wear, corrosion, thermal cycling,
fractography, adhesive bonding, sandwich structures and many others. Some of these are included in the references, however, it should be
remembered that the references are but a partial
list of presently available literature.


Finally, one cannot stress the point too
strongly that, as of the present writing, a
design for fatigue resistance does not necessarily cost weight. An example of this is a
case where 300 military airplanes were modified
to bring them up to desired fatigue life. It
cost 3200 man hours per airplane which amounted
to $11,000,000 for the job, including materials
(from Ref. 33). The final airplane was no
heavier than the original. It might be argued
that the original weight was not based on
optimum design and that even the modified airplanes might not meet fatigue standards set in
the future. Be that as it may, while we can
expect more efficient designs which will reduce
weight for static considerations, we can also
expect design innovations that will increase
fatigue resistance.

APPENDIX A--FATIGUE DATA


This appendix includes fatigue properties
of some aircraft materials taken from Ref. 40.
While fatigue properties of metals are being
developed daily, it is impossible to include
all that might be available. Accordingly, one
should refer to original sources for additions.
Balfour Engineering Co., Suttons Bay, Mich. is
continuing to collect fatigue data and is a
likely source of new data. Another data source,
not necessarily for aircraft materials, is
given in Cazaudrs Fatigue of Metals (see bibliography) .


Some caution should be used in applying
these data in that the values presented are for
averages and are not guaranteed minimums. Also,
it would appear that much of the notched data
were acqUired on specimens having notches small
enough to experience the "NeUber" effect which
relates severity of a notch to grain size.
Accordingly, it follows that the concentration
might be more severe for the same geometrical
configuration on a larger piece of structure.
Since Kt is approximately equal to Kf at about
10 [7] cycles (see C13.2), one can jUdge the severity of the notches used in these data and make
appropriate corrections if needed.

**CHAPTER** **Dl**

**FITTINGS** **AND** **CONNECTIONS.** **BOLTED** **AND** **RIVETED.**



**Dl.** **1** Introduction.


The ideal flight vehicle structure would
be the single complete unit of the same material
involving one manufacturing operation. Unfortunately the present day types of materials
and their method of working dictates a composite
structure. Furthermore general requirements of
repair, maintenance and stowage dictate a
structure of several main units held to other
units by main or primary fittings or connections, with each unit incorporating many
primary and secondary connections involving
fittings, bolts, rivets, welding, etc. No
doubt main or primary fittings involve more
weight and cost per unit volume than any other
part of the aerospace structure, and therefore
fitting and joint design plays an important
part in aerospace structural design.


**Dl.** 2 Economy in Fitting Design.


For structural economy the structural
designer in the initial layout of the flight
vehicle should strive to use a minimum number
of fittings particularly those fittings connecting units which carry large loads. Thus
in a wing structure splicing the main beam
flanges or introducing fittings near the
centerline of the airplane are far more costly
than splices or fittings placed farther outboard where member sizes and loads are considerably smaller. Avoid changes in direction
of heavy members such as wing beams and fuselage longerons as these involve heavy fittings.
If joints are necessary in continuous beams
place them near points of inflection in order
that the bending moments to be transferred
through the joint be kept of small magnitude.
In column design with end fittings avoid introducing eccentricit1"es on the beam and on the
other hand make use of the fitting to increase
column end fiKity thus compensating some of
the weight increase due to fitting weight by
saving in the weight of the beam.


For economy of fabrication, the structur'il
designer should have a good knowledge of shop
processes and operations. The cost of fitting
fabric&tion and assembly varies greatly With the
type of fitting, shape and the required tolerances. Poor layout of major fitting arrangement
may require very expensive tools and jigs for
shop fabrication and assembly.


Fittings likewise add considerably to the



cost of inspection and rejections of costly
fittings because of faulty workmanship or
materials are qUite frequent, thus adding
greatly to the unit cost.


**Dl.** 3 Fitting Design Loads. Minimum Margins of Safety.


As discussed in other chapters, limit
loads are the maximum loads, which a flight
vehicle may be subjected to during its lifetime, when carrying out the required ground
and flight operations. The limit loads must be
carried by the structure without exceeding the
yield stress of the material used in the
structure. The Ultimate or design loads are
the limit loads multiplied by a factor of
safety, usually 1.5 for aircraft and less for
missiles. The structure must have sufficient
strength to carry the ultimate or design loads
without failure.


The normal flight vehicle structure involves many parts which are joined together by
various types of connections. In general, an
additional blanket factor of safety is reqUired
for design of these connections. This blanket
factor of safety is normally 1.15 to 1.20. The
stress analysis of most connections or fittings
is more complicated than for the primary
structural members due to such factors as combined stresses, stress concentration, bolt-hole
tightness, etc., thus an additional factor of
safety is necessary to give a similar degree of
strength reliability for connections as provided
in the strength design of the members being
connected.


**Dl.** 4 Special or Higher Factors of Safety.


A blanket factor of safety for all types of
fittings or load conditions is not logical. The
manner in which a load is applied to a joint
often involves adynamic or shock load, as for
example joints or fittings in landing gear.
Single pin connections often undergo rotation
or movement between adjacent parts, thus producing faster wearing away of material in operation. Repeated loads often present a fatigue
problem. In an airplane or missile there are
certain main fittings which, if they failed,
would definitely cause tIle loss of the vehicle.
Thus the design fitting requirements of the
military and ciVil aviation agencies involve
many special or higher factors of safety. This
is so particularly in design involving castings.

**D1. 2** **FITTINGS** **AND** **CONNECTIONS.** **BOLTED** **AND** **RIVETED.**



**D1. 5** **Aircraft** **Bolts.**


The aircraft bolt is used primarily to
transfer relatively large shear or tension
loads from one structural member to another.
Fig. **Dl.l** shows three standard aircraft bolts
in common use. There are other types but they
will not be presented in this limited chapter
on connections.


Hexagon Head


Clevis


Internal
Wrenching

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-934-0.png)


**Fig.** **D1.1**


The hexagon head bolt is an Army-Navy
standard bolt made from SAE 2330-3.5 percent
nickel steel, heat treated to an ultimate
tensile strength of 125,000 psi. The bolt head
is of sufficient size as to develop the full
tensile strength of the bolt.


The internal-wrenching bolt is a high
strength steel bolt usually heat treated from
160,000 to 180,000 psi. It is especially
suitable for main splice fittings because of
its high strength and the relatively small
space required for the bolt head.


The clevis bolt is referred to as a shear
bolt because its head is not designed to
develop the full tensile strength of the bolt.
The clevis bolt is usually used when a group
or cluster of bolts is required to transfer a
load by shear loads on the bolts. The smaller
bolt heads thus save weight and also provide
greater bolt head clearances. The clevis bolt
will develop about one half the tensile strength
of the standard AN hexagon head bolt.


The three bolts are also made from aluminum
alloy for diameters over 1/4 inch. In many
fitting designs weight can be saved by using
aluminum alloy bolts.


General Rules in Using Bolts.


Bolt threads should not be placed in
bearing or shear. The length of the bolt shank
should be such that not more than one thread
extends below fitting surface, which can be
done by the use of washers.


Bolts less than 3/8 diameter should not be
used in major fittings. For steel bolts, 3/16



inch diameter should be the smallest size to be
used in any fitting.


Bolts connecting parts having relative
motion or stress reversal should have close
tolerances to decrease shock loads.


For bolts connecting members having relative motion a lubricator should be incorporated
in the surrounding parts of the fitting; the
fitting should not be drilled to provide lubrication.


Bolts should be used in double or multiple
shear if possible in order to increase strength
efficiency in bolt shear and to decrease bending
tendency on bolt.


**D1. 6** **Aircraft** **Nuts.**


Fig. Dl.2 illustrates four standard steel
aircraft nuts. Nut material is more ductile
than bolt material, thus when the nut is
tightened the threads will deflect to seat on
the bolt threads.


The Castle nut is probably the most common
aircraft nut. It develops the full rated
strength of the bolts. The nut has slots milled
in it so that nuts can be prevented from turning.


The Shear nut is only one half as thick as
the Castle nut, and thus has only threads enough
to develop one half of bolt tensile strength.
It is used with a clevis bolt which has a screw
driver slot to limit the torsion in tightening
the nut. The nut is also castellated for cotter
pin lock.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-934-1.png)


**CASTLE NUT** **SHEAR NUT** **PLAIN NUT** **SELF** **LOCKING**
**AN - 310** **AN - 320** **AN - 315** **AC** **- 365**


**Fig.** **D1. 2**


The Plain nut which is very seldom used in
present design is used for permanent locations
and is locked by "peening" or riveting the end
of the bolt over the nut, an operation which
destroys the bolt protective coating or finish.


Aluminum Alloy Nuts. Aluminum alloy nuts
are not used on bolts designed for tension.
Sometimes aluminum alloy nuts are used on steel
bolts on land planes to save weight provided the
bolts are cadmium plated. If the bolt is used
in places where the nut is repeatedly removed,
neither bolt or nut should be aluminum alloy
because of the danger of injuring the relatively
soft threads.


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-935-full.png)

Self Locking Nuts. Self loclcing nuts are
widely used in aircraft industry and there are
a number of types on the market. Fig. Dl.2

~hows one type of self locking nut involving a
fiber insert. When the bolt reaches the fiber
collar it tends to push the fiber up because
the hole in the collar is smaller than the
bolt, and is not threaded. The fiber ring thus
sets up a heavy downward pressure on the bolt
automatically throwing the load carrying sides
of the nut and bolt threads into positive
contact. ThuR all play in the threads is

eli~inated and a friction is set up between
every bolt and nut thread in conRtant. This
constant pressure which is maintained on
threads, provil1es the friction which prevents
nut from moving under vibration. The use of
the self locking nut reduces the assembly costs
as it eliminates the bothersome cotter pin
which takes extra operations of the mechanic
and is very difficult to install on the nut
in the many joints and corners of an airplane.
In another type of self locking nut, the locking
force is provided by the spring action of the
upper part of a specially designed nut.


D1. 7 Bolt Shear, Tension & Bending Strengths.


Table Dl.l gives the section properties
and the ultimate shear, tension and bending
strengths for AN Standard Steel bolts at room
temperature. Fig. Dl.3 shows the correction
to be applied to the strength values in Table
Dl.l when bolts are sUbj ected to elevated
temperatures. Table Dl.2 gives the tensile
and double shear strengths of Steel Internal
Wrenching bolts. Table Dl.2a gives ultimate
shear, tension and bending strengths for
aluminum alloy bolts. The value of Fb' the
modulus of rupture, was determined by the
method given in Chapter C3.

for the various AN steel bolt sizes. The curves
are not applicable where shear nuts are used.

load tests With nuts fingertight.


D1. 8a Bushings.


It is customary to provide bushings in the
lugs of single bolt or pin fittings SUbjected
to reversal of stress or to slight rotation.
Thus if wear and tear takes place a new bushing
can be inserted in the lug fitting. Steel
bushings are commonly used in aluminum alloy

single bolt fitting lugs to increase the allowable bearing stress on the lug since the
bushing increases the bearing diameter 1/8 inch
since bushings are usually 1/16 inch in wall
thickness. If bushings are not used on single
bolt connections sufficient edge distance
should be provided to ream hole for next size
bolt in case of excessive wear of the unbushed
hole. If considerable rotation occurs a
lubricator should be provided for a plain
bushing or an oil-impregnated bushing should
be used.


D1. 9 Single Bolt Fitting.


Possibly the simplest method of joining
two members together is the use of a single
bolt or pin connection. Such a joint can transmit relatively large loads and yet the joint is
easily and quickly disconnected.


Fig. Dl.6 illustrates the four general
methods of connecting two members by a single
bolt. First the connection is made symmetrical
about the centerline of the load on the joint.
Thus is Fig. Dl.6a the load P on the male part
of the fitting divides equally and symmetrically
to the two female plates or units which make up
part of the fitting unit. If the male and
female parts of the connection are to be tied
together by a single bolt it is evident that
the connecting plates will be weakened due to
the bolt hole unless extra material is added at
the bolt hole section.


Fig. Dl.6a shows a fitting consisting of
three rectangular plates of uniform section

throu~hout fastened together by a single bolt.
Obviously the weak section for the plates in
tension would be a section through the centerline of the hole. If this section is strong
enough to carry the given loads, then the remaining part of the fitting members are
considerably over strength. To avoid this
over-strength which means extra weight of fitting
units, a single bolt fitting unit is often made
like one of the examples indicated in Fig. b, c
and d of Fig. Dl.6.


In Fig. b, the plates are made constant
thickness but increased in width in the vicinity
of the hole section. In Fig. c, the width of
the plates is kept constant but the thickness
of the plates are increased in the vicinity of
the hole section, and in Fig. d, both width and
thickness of plates are changed.

Fig. D1. 5 Combined Shear and Tension on AN Steel Bolts



As the load on a fitting is transferred
from one side of the fitting to the other, internal stresses are produced which tend to cause
the fitting to fail in several different ways.

Failure by Bolt Shear.


In Fig. Dl.7 the bushing is not continuous
between the plates, but each of the three
plates have separate bushings. As the pull P
is placed on the fitting it tends to shear the
bolt at sections (1-1) and (2-2), (Fig. Dl.7a).
Fig. Dl.7b illustrates the forces or pressures
on the bolt and the failure which can take
place if the stresses are sUfficient.


Let Pu represent the maximum or ultimate
load on the fitting. This force Pu must be
resisted by the shear strength of the bolt at
the two sections (1-1) and (2-2). Hence,


PU(bolt shear) - F su - A.2 - - - - - (1)


where F su = ultimate shearing stress for bolt
material.
A = cross-sectional area of bolt.


Failure by Bolt Ben~ing.


The main concern regarding bolt bending
is that under the limit loads any bending
deflection of the bolt be not permanent as such
deformation would make removal of the bolt
difficult. The sUbject of bolt bending
stresses is discussed in a later article.


Failure of Lug Portion of Fitting.


The lug portion of the fitting refers to
that portion of the fitting that involves the
hole for the single bolt that connects the
male and female parts of the fitting unit. The
simplified assumptions regarding failing action
and the resulting equations which follow have
been widely used for quick approximate check
of the lug strength. The procedure which
follows will be referred to as Method 1.

METHOD 1 OF BOLT & LUG STRENGTH ANALYSIS


Failure in Tension.


Fig. Dl.8 indicates how a fitting plate can
pull apart due to tension stresses on a section
through the centerline of the bolt hole. Both
the male and female parts of the fitting must
transfer the load past the centerline of the
hole, thus both parts must be considered in the
design of a fitting. Equating the allowable
load Pu to the ultimate resisting tensile
stresses at points (a) and (b) Fig. Dl.8, we
obtain,


PU(tension) = Ftu (2R - D)t - - - - - - - - (2)


where Ftu = ultimate tensile strength of plate
material.


Equation (2) assumes that the tensile stress on
the cross-section is uniform. This is not true
as the flow of stress around the hole causes a
stress concentration. To take care of this
stress concentration requires a margin of safety
of 25 percent.


Failure by Shear Tear Out.


Fig. Dl.4 illustrates the manner in which
failure can occur by the shearing tear out of a
plate sector in front of the bolt. In Fig. a,


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-938-full.png)

~~D1.6~~ ~~FITTINGS~~ ~~AND~~ ~~CONNECTIONS.~~ ~~BOLTED~~ ~~AND~~ ~~RIVETED.~~



the load P causes the bolt (not shown) to press
on the plate around the bolt hole edge.
Stresses are produced which tend to cause the
portion (a) in Fig. (b) to tear out as shoivn.
Equating the load Pu to the ultimate shear
resistance of the materi~l times the area of
the two shear out areas, we can write,


                             -                              -                              -                              -                              -                              (3)


where F su = ultimate shearing strength of the
pla te material.
As = shear out area.


It is very common practice to take the
shear out area As equ~l to the edge distance
at the centerline of the hole times the
thickness t of the plate times two since there
are two shear areas. This is slightly conservative because the actual shear area is
larger. Ref. 1 permits one to use the area
along line 1-1 which is limited by the 40
degree line as shown in Fig. Dl.9c.


Failure by Bearing of Bushing on Plate.


In Fig. Dl.10a, the pull P causes the bolt
(not shown) to press against bushing wall which
in turn presses against the plate wall. If the
pressure is high enough the plate material ad
j~cent to the hole will start to crush and flow
thus allowing the bolt and bushing to move
which results in the elongated hole as
illustrated in Fig. b. Equating the load Pu to
the ultimate bearing strength on the bearing
surfaces we can write,



as before,


Pu = Fbr D t


where D = bolt diameter



- - - - - - - - - (5)



Pu = Fbr D t


where Fbr = allowable bearing stress
D = diameter of bushing
t = plate thickness



- - (4)



It is good practice to require a margin
of safety of 50 percent.


Failure by Bearing of Bolt Bushing.


A bushing is pressed into the plate hole
and thus it is considered as a tight fit. A
fitting bolt is usually considered as removable
therefore a certain tolerance between the bolt
and bushing inside diameters is necessary in
order to insert and remove bolt. If fitting is
subjected to reversible loads the small slop in
the fitting tends to cause shock on the fitting.
Also the fitting may be such that slight
rotation takes place on the bolt, which tendS
to cause wear between bolt and bushing. It is
therefore customary to check the bearing
pressure between the bolt and the bushing since
failure of the bushing could take place in a
manner explained in the previous article dealing with bearing of bushing on pl~te. Then



A margin of safety of 50 percent should be
maintained. If the fitting is sUbjected to
infrequent rotation under load but with load
involving no shock or vibration, require a
margin of safety of 100 percent. If shock or
vibration with infrequent rotation is present,
require a margin of safety of 150 percent.
Shock is considered to occur in such structures
as l~nding gears, gun mounts, hoisting, mooring
and towing connections.


General Comment on Margins of Safety for Lugs.


In general it is good design practice to
design lugs conservatively as the weight of
lugs is small relative to their importance in
insuring the safety of the flight vehicle. Inaccuracies in manufacture are difficult to
control. It is good design practice to provide
sufficient material to permit drilling for a
bushing if bushing is not used in original
design. If castings are used as fittings,
much higher factors of safety on the limit loads
are specified because of the low ductibility of
the material in castings.


**D1.** **11** Method 2. Lug strength Analysis Under Axial
Loading.


Due to a comprehensive stUdy and test
program by Cozzone, Melcon and Hobbit (Refs. 3
and 4), the procedure as given in Method 1 is
somewhat modified. The important difference
is that curves derived from test results give
the stress concentration factor to use for
tension on the net section and the shear out
failure as assumed in Method 1 has been re
pl~ced by a combined shear-out bearing failure.
Fig. Dl.ll shows the lug-pin combinations and
types of failure as taken from Ref. 3.

Tension Across the Net Section.


Because of stress concentration, the
stress on the net cross-section cannot be
taken as uniform. The ultimate allowable
tensIon load Pu for lug equals,

where Kt is the stress concentration factor as

Dl. 14 Bolt Bending Strength.


In general static tests of single bolt
fittings will not show a failure due to bolt
bending failure. However, it is important that
sufficient bending strength be provided to
prevent permanent bending deformation of the
fitting bolt under the limit loads so that
bolts can be readily removed in maintenance
operations. Furthermore, bolt bending weakness
can cause peaking up a non-uniform bearing
pressure on the fitting lugs thus influencing
the lug tension and shear strength. The
unknown factor in bolt bending is the true
value of the bending moment on the bolt because
the moment arm to the resultant bearing forces
is unknown. An approximate method (Ref. 4)
for determining the arm (b) to use in calculating the bending moment on bolt is given in
Fig. Dl.16, which gives b = .5t~ + .25t 2 + g
where g is clearance or gap between lugs. The
resulting bending moment is considered to be
conservative. (See Ref. 4 for other refinements relative to determining moment arm b.)



D1.9


shown. On the vertical scale we locate point
(y) at tension load of 5800 lbs., and draw
horizontal dashed line to give point (a). A
straight line through points (0) and (a) is
drawn and extended to intersect the curve for
a 5/8 AN bolt at point (b). Projecting downward from point (b) to lower scale, we obtain
PS(allow) = 22400 lb. and projecting horizontally


we obtain Pt(allow) = 7700 lb.


Then M.S. = (PS(allow)/x)   - 1 = (22400/


16700) - 1 = .34 or M.S. = (Pt(allow)/y) - 1

: (7700/5800) - 1 = .34.


The specified required M.S. was .25, thus
bolt strength is satisfactory.


PROBLEM 2.


Fig. Dl.17 shows a single pin fitting. The
lug material is AISI Steel, heat treated to Ftu
= 125000 psi. The bolt is AN steel, Ftu =
125000. The bushing is steel with Ftu = 125000.
The fitting is sUbjected to an ultimate tension
load of 15650 lb. The fitting will be strength
checked for the design load. The check will be
made by both Methods 1 and 2.

SOLUTION BY METHOD 1.

Dl. 15 Illustrative Problems.



PROBLEM 1. An engine mount fitting is attached
to the nacelle fitting by a 5/8 diameter AN
steel bolt. The ulti~ate or design loads on
the bolt are tension = 5800 lbs. and shear =
16700 lbs. Due to vibration a 25 percent
margin of safety will be required.


Solution:- This is a problem of combined
tension and shear on a bolt. Use is made of
curves in Fig. Dl.4 which are interaction
curves for combined tension and shear. On Fig.
Dl.4 at a value on lower scale equal to the
shear load of 16700 lb., labeled point (x) on
the figure, we erect a vertical dashed line as



A fitting factor of safety of 1.15 will be
used which is standard practice for military
airplanes.


Design Fitting Load = 1.15 x 15650 =
18000 lb.


Check of Bolt Shear Strength.


Bolt is in double shear. From Table Dl.l,
single shear strength of 1/2 inch diameter AN
steel bolt is 14700 lb.


Whence Pu = 2 x 14700 = 29400 lb.


M.S. = (29400/18000) - 1 =.62

**Dl.I0** **FITTINGS** **AND** **CONNECTIONS.** **BOLTED** **AND** **RIVETED.**



Check Bending of Bolt.


Referring to Fig. Dl.16, the moment arm
for calculating bending moment on bolt is,


b = 0.5t:l. + 0.25t 2 + g (take g as 1/64 inch)
b = 0.5 (.218) + 0.25 (.375) + .0156 = .218 inches
Bending moment on bolt = .5Pb = .5 x 18000 x .218
= 1965 in. lb.
fb = fu/I = (1965x .2.5)/.003069 = 160000 psi.
(See Table Dl.l for bolt moment of inertia)


From Table Dl.l, Fb for AN Steel bolts is
180,000.


Therefore M.S. = (180000/160000) -1 = .12


Check of Lug A.


This lug is more critical than lug B
since thickness of lug B is more than one-half
of lug A.


Check of Tension Through Bolt Hole.


Pu = Ftu At


Pu = 125000 x (1.1875 - .625) .375 = 26400 lb.


M.S. = (26400/18000) - 1 = .46


To take care of stress concentration,
Method 1 says maintain a M.S. of .25, thus lug
tensile strength is O.K.


Check of Shear Out Strength of Lug.


Pu = F su As ' F su = 82000


Pu = 82000 x (.5937 - .3125)2 x .375 = 17300 lb.


This value is under the design fitting load of
18000 lb. It is permissible to take a slightly
greater shear out distance than the edge
distance as used (see Fig. Dl.9c). The
additional distance to the 40 degree line would
add enough shear out area to give a positive
margin of safety. This method of calculating
shear out strength is conservative as will be
brought out by the result in Method 2 solution.


Bearing Strength.


The bushing and lug have the same ultimate
strength (Ftu), thus bearing will be critical
for bolt on bushing since bearing area is less.


An extra 50 percent margin of safety is
required or the allowable bearing stress Fbr
should be divided by 1.5.


Pu = (194000/1.50) .50 x .375 = 24300 lb.


M.S. = (24300/18000) - 1 = .35



SOLUTION BY METHOD 2.


Bolt Shear Strength and Bolt Bending
Strength are calculated in the same manner as
in Method 1 and thus the calculations will not
be repeated.


Tension Net Section


Pu = Kt Ftu At


Kt is the tension efficiency factor to take
care of stress concentration due to the hole and
is determined from Fig. Dl.12. Table Dl.3 says
to use curve number 1 for all steels. To use
Fig. Dl.12 requires the ratio WiD = (1.1875/.625)
= 1.9. Then from Fig. Dl.12 we read Kt = .98,
whence,


**P** **u** **=** **.98** **x** **125000** **x** **(1.1875** **-** **.625).375** **=**
25800 lb.


M.S. = (25800/18000) - 1 = .43.


Fig. Dl.12 says that a M.S. of .15 is
appropriate over that of all required fitting
factors of safety, thus our M.S. of .43 provides
more than this additional M.S. of .15.


Shear Bearing Strength.


Pbru = Kbru Ftu A br


Kbru is the shear-bearing efficiency factor
and is obtained from Fig. Dl.13.


D/t = .625/.375 = 1.65
e/D = .5937/.625 = .95


From Fig. Dl.13, we read Kbru = .80


Pbru = .80 x 125000 x .625 x .375 = 23400 lb.


M.S. = (23400/18000) - 1 = .30


The reader should note shear out strength
by Method 2 is considerably larger than by
Method 1. Fig. Dl.13 says a .15 M.S. is appropriate, thus our 0.30 is satisfactory.


Bushing Yield.


Pbry = 1.85 F cy A br, Fcy = 113000 for steel
with Ftu = 125000.


Pbry = 1.85 x 113000 x .500 x .375 = 39000 lb.


M.S. = (39000/18000) 1 = 1.17


General Conclusion.


Since all margins of safety are positive,
the strength of fitting unit is satisfactory.
It could be redesigned to save weight. Moving


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-943-full.png)

the hole slightly back of the center of the
lug radius would help shear out strength. This
change would permit decreasing the thickness of
lug slightly. Decreasing the lug thickness
would decrease the bolt bending moment and
possibly permit use of 7/16 diameter bolt. The
student should redesign the lug.

Let Pu equal ultimate strength of the

The hinge pin diameter is 5/8 and material

Fsu = 95000. Pin is in double shear.

M.S. = (58300/33000) - 1 = .77.


Check Bending Strength of Hinge Pin.


The bending moment arm (b) on pin from
Fig. Dl.16 is


b = .5t 1 + .25t 2 + g. The clearance g will be
taken as 1/64 inch .



Abr = .375 x .625 = .234, Aar/Abr = .126/.234

b = .5 x .3125 + .25 x .625 + 1/64 = .328 in.

Table Dl.4 indicates curve 1 is used for
steel material With Ftu up to 125000 psi. Then = Pin 5410 bending in. lb. moment M = .5Pb = .5 x 33000 x .328
from Fig. Dl.15, we read Ktu = .74.



Pin bending moment M = .5Pb = .5 x 33000 x .328
= 5410 in. lb.



Then, Ptu = .74x .234 x 125000 = 21600 lb.



fb = Mr/I = 5410 x .3125/.00749 = 226000 psi.



PROBLEM 4. The modulus of rupture in bending Fb will
be calculated by the method of Chapter C3.

Fig. Dl.18 shows a steel forked fitting
bolted to a double channel section made from Fb = Ftu + f o (k - 1)
7075-T6 aluminum alloy. The hinge pin is 5/8

From Table C3.2 for steel With Ftu =

diameter AISI Steel, heat treated to Ftu =
150000. Steel fitting is also 150000 steel. we find f o = 146000.
A strength check of the fitting will be carried
out. For a solid round bar K = 1.7 (see Fig.



Fb = Ftu + f o (k - 1)



From Table C3.2 for steel With Ftu = 150000,
we find f o = 146000.

D1. 16 Bolt Loads for Multiple Bolt Fitting.
Bolts Sizes Different. Concentric Loading.


In designing or strength checking a
multiple bolt fitting, the question arises as
to what proportion of the total fitting load
does each bolt transfer. This distribution
could be affected by many things such as bolt
fit or bolt tightness in the hole; bearing
deformation or elongation of the bolt hole;
shear deformation of the bolt or pin; tension
or compressive axial deformation of the fitting
members and the member being connected, and a
number of other minor influences.


Since aircraft materials have a considerable degree of ductility, if the fitting is
properly designed, the loads on the bolts when
the loads on the fitting approach their maximum
value, will tend to be in proportion to the
shear strength of the bolt. That is, if the
combined shear strength of the bolts is the
critical strength, the yielding of the fitting
material in bearing, shear and tension will
tend to equalize the load on the bolts in
proportion to their shear strengths. For
stresses below the elastic limit of the fitting
plates the bolt load distribution no doubt is
more closely proportional to the bearing area
of each bolt. Since the primary interest is
failing strength, the bolt load distribution
in proportion to the bolt shear strengths is
usually assumed.


Let:

P = design load on fitting.
Ps = allowable shear strength of any bolt.
Pn = load on bolt n.
P sn = allowable shear strength of bolt n.


|Bolt<br>Sym.|Bolt<br>Dia.|Double Shear Strength<br>= Ps|
|---|---|---|

Distribution of loads to each bolt:

P sa 46020
Pa = P (z ps ) = 100000 x 117340 = 39200 lb.


Pb = 100,000 x 37274/117340 = 31800 lb.


Pc = 100,000 x 22544/117340 = 19200 lb.


Pd = 100,000 x 11502/117340 = 9800 lb.


Total load on the four bolts adds up to
100,000 lb.


D1. 17 Multiple Riveted or Bolted Joints Subjected
to Eccentric Loads.


Fig. Dl.21 shows a plate fitting attached
to another member by means of four bolts or
rivets. (The circles represent the bolts). The
fitting plate is SUbjected to the loads PH and
Py acting as shown. Let it be required to find
the resultant loads on the bolt group due to the
given loads.


The centroid of resistance for the bolt
group will then correspond to the centroid of
the bolt areas. Fig. Dl.22 shows the fitting
unit With the force PH and Py replaced by an
eqUivalent force system at the bolt group
centroid point (0). This equivalent force
system will be:

Py = -200 lb., PH = 1000 lb.

D1.14 FITTINGS AND CONNECTIONS. BOLTED AND RIVETED.


For the bolt group of Fig. Dl.22 ra = rb =
r c = rd = 1.25".

Hence, I = Zr [2] = 4 x 1.25 [2] = 6.25 in.


Therefore the moment load Fm on each bolt
will equal


F = Mr = -600 x 1. 25 = 120 1b
m I 6.25                   

Fig. C4.31 shows the resulting H, Y and
moment loads applied to each bolt. The resultant
load can be found graphically by drawing the
force polygons as shown in Fig. Cl.23. The
resultant bolt loads can likewise be determined
analytically. For example consider bolt (c)


ZH = 250 + 120 x 1.~5 + 0 = 346 lb.



![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-946-0.png)

and Mo = -200 x 1.75 - 1000 x .25 = -600 in.lb.


Since Py and PH act through the bolt
centroid they will be reacted equally by each
bolt, hence Y load on each bolt due to Pv =
-200/4 = -50 lb.; H load on each bolt due to
PH = 1000/4 = 250 lb.


The load produced on each bolt due to the
moment load Mo = -600 in. lb. will vary directly
as the distance of the bolt from the center of
resistance which coincides with the bolt group
centroid.


Let r a equal the distance from the bolt
group centroid to bolt (a). Then the resisting
moment developed by bolt (a) equals Far a, where
Fa equals the load on bolt (a). Since the bolt
loads are proportional to their distance from
0, the resisting moment Mb developed by bolt
(b) will equal


rb rt 2
(Fa --)rb or Fa ---, and similarly for bolt (c)
r a r a

r c 2 _ rd 2
Mc = Fa --- and for bolt d - Fa --ra r a


The total moment resistance of the bolt
group therefore equals,

Fr 2+Fr 2+Fr 2+Fr 2
M = a a a b a cad -(14)
r a


hence,


                    - - - -(15)


where I = Z r [2] of bolt group.


Therefore for the loads on the other bolts,

= Mr c .
F c I'



ZY = -50   - 120 x ft + 0 = -122 lb.


Hence R = /ZH [2 ] + Zy [2] = v346 [2 ] + 122 [2] = 367 lb.


Case Where Bolts or Rivets are of Different
Diameters.


When the joint bolts or rivets are not all
the same size, the moment load on each bolt is
proportional to the bolt area times its distance
to the bolt group centroid. Thus the bolt areas
must enter equation (15).


hence,


l1A a r a

Fa = n A r 2 + n. A r 2+ n A r 2 +n A r 2
a a a D b b c c c d d d


                    - - - -(16)


n = number of bolts of each size.


Since theory of loads on a multiple bolt
group is only approximate, reasonable margins
of safety should be maintained.


RIVETED CONNECTIONS


Dl. 18 Types of Rivets.


From an aerospace structural standpoint
rivets may be placed into two general classifications, namely:

(1) The Protruding Head type of rivet.


(2) The Flush type rivet.


Fig. Dl.24 illustrates the protruding head
type of rivet. Fig. Dl.25
illustrates a number of ~
modifications of the pro- ~
truding head type of rivet
that have been used in the Fig. Dl. 24
past.

For many years the round head rivet was
used for all interior work and before the era
of high speeds it was used as a surface rivet
as well. When wind tunnel experiments showed
that such rivets gave appreciable drag,
designers turned to rivets with less head
protrusion, thus the development of the Brazier
and modified Brazier type of rivet head. Then
as the age of relatively high airplane speeds
arrived a flush surface was needed, particularly
on certain sensitive portions of the airplane
surface, thus various modifications of the
countersunk head involving press and machine
countersinking of the sheets were developed.


Fig. Dl.26 illustrates the flush type of
rivet. As illustrated in Fig. Dl.26, this
flush type rivet can be used in several different ways, thus the method shown in Fig. Dl.26a
is referred to as the machine countersunk type;
that in Fig. Dl.26b as the press countersunk
double dimpled type; and that in Fig. Dl.26c as
the combined press and machine countersunk type
or the dimpled machine countersunk type.

Dl. 19 Rivet Material. Fa = F su A n - - - -(17)



Since aluminum alloy is by far the most
widely used material in the aircraft industry,
it follows that aluminum alloy is the material
most widely used for rivets. Table Dl.5
(column 1) lists the 5 aluminum alloys used
for rivets and the ultimate shearing stress
F su for each material. Rivets made from
2017-T3 (F su = 34000) and 2024-T31 (F su =
41000) are rivets that must be driven soon
after heat treatment or before age hardening
takes place. The aging or hardening is slowed
by keeping rivets in refrigeration after heat
treatment. The other rivet material is less
hard or less brittle in the aged state and thus
can be stored in air and driven anytime. These
so-called softer rivets have less shear
strength, but since a great deal of aircraft
construction involves thin sheet, bearing is
often critical and thus rivet shear is not
critical. Most surface or skin riveting
involves the softer rivet, usually 2117-T3
(F su = 30,000).


Dl. 20 Strength of Rivets. Protruding Head Type.


Rivets are widely used in airplane
structures to fasten or tie together two or
more structural units. Standard methods of
stress analyses of riveted joints consider two
primary types of failure, namely, the shear of
the shank of the rivet and the bearing or
compressive failure of the metal at the point
where the rivet bears against the connecting
sheet or plate.


Fig. Dl.28 illustrates the main forces on
a rivet in transferring a load from one plate
to another. The load is transferred to the
rivet from the plate by bearing of the plate
on the rivet. The load is then transferred
along the rivet and resisted by bearing action
on the other plate. Since the plate bearing
forces on the rivet are not in the same line,
the forces tend to shear and bend the rivet.
Bending of the rivet is usually neglected if
there are no intermediate filler plates. In
Fig. (a) of Dl.28, the rivet is in single shear,
whereas in Fig. (b) the rivet is in double
shear.

Fig. Dl. 28

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-948-0.png)

The ultimate shear strength of a rivet is
given by the following equation:


where, Fa = ultimate shear strength of rivets
(lbs. )
F su = ultimate allowable shear stress for
rivet (psi)
A = area of rivet cross-section = 11: D 2 /4,
where D equals the nominal rivet
hole diameter.
n number of shear areas per rivet.


Reference (17) shows that the shear strength of
protruding head aluminum alloy rivets is affected
by increasing D/t (Diameter of rivet over sheet
thickness) ratios. The conclusions in Reference
(17) are as follows:

Rivets in Single Shear:

For values of D/t up to 3:Single shear strength = basic allowable single
shear strength.


For values of D/t greater than 3:Single shear strength = basic allowable single
shear strength times

[1-0.04 (D/t-3)J


For Rivets in Double Shear:

For values of D/t up to 1.5:Double shear strength = basic allowable double
shear strength.


For values of D/t greater than 1.5:Double shear strength = basic allowable double
shear strength times

[1- 0.13 (D/t -1.5)J


Table Dl.5 (from Ref. 2) gives the shear
strength of protruding and flush head aluminum
alloy rivets and the corrections to take care
of the D/t influence on the rivet shear
strength. Table Dl.8 gives the allowable
bearing strengths between the protruding head
rivet and the various aluminum alloy sheet and
plate material. The bearing values are given
for two e/D ratios, namely 1.5 and 2.0, where
e is the edge distance measured from the center
of the hole to the edge of the plate. Any
reduction in edge distance may cause bulging
of the edge of the sheet due to driving energy.
Edge distance shoUld not be less than e/D = 1.5.


Dl. 21 Strength of Rivets. Flush Type.


Since flush rivets have no protruding head
on the flush end of the rivet and also since
flush riveting involves machine countersinking
or press countersinking or both, the strength of
the flush type rivet is different than the
common protruding head type.


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-949-full.png)

D1.17



Fig. Dl.29 illustrates a machine countersunk rivet. Due to the pull P on the two
sheets which are held together by the rivet and
induced force Pi is produced on the sloping
side of the head of the rivet. This induced
force tends to shear and bend the portion 1-1
of the rivet head. The sharp edge of the
countersunk sheet at point (a) tends to cut
into the rivet. These combined influences tend
to cause excessive deflections and finally
failure as roughly illustrated in Fig. Dl.30.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-949-2.png)


Fig. Dl. 30


In the press countersunk or dimpled type
of flush rivet connection, see Fig. Dl.26b and
c, because of the interlocking of the sheets
due to the dimple, the joint could transmit a
load without a rivet if the sheets were held
together. Since there is no clearly defined
bearing or shear surface in this type of joint,
the manner in which the loads are transferred
is qUite complex. As a result resort must be
made to tests to establish design allowables.
Tables Dl.7, Dl.ll and Dl.12 give the ultimate
and yield strength of flush type rivets
(Ref. 2).


Dl. 22 Blind Rivets.


The name "Blind" rivet is given to that
type of rivet which can be completely installed
from one side of the joint, and is therefore
almost exclusively used where it is impossible
or impractical to drive the normal rivet, which
requires access to both sides of the joint.
There are two general types of blind rivets,
namely where the inside or blind head is formed
mechanically or where it is formed by an
explosive force.


Fig. Dl.31 illustrates the Dupont
explosive type and Figs. 32 to 34a inclusive
illustrate the mechanically formed head type.

Dl. 23 Riveted Sheet Splice Information.


In splicing or connecting two sheets together by means of rivets or bolts, the joint
or connection may fail in the various ways as
explained in detail for single and multiple bolt
fitting units. Thus one must check the shear
strength of the rivets; bearing of rivets on the
sheets; tear out of the sheet edges and tension
on sections through the rivet holes.


Types of Sheet Splices or Connections.


Fig. Dl.35 illustrates the various types
of sheet splices. In the offset lap splice
between two sheets of different gauges, the
offset should be in the heavier material. For
a Single shear butt splice, the butt splice
plate should be equal to the thinnest of the
two sheets being spliced and likewise in the

Proper Rivet Size to Use.


No exact rules can be given relative to
the optimum rivet for a given splice, because
a number of practical considerations usually
enter into the design of a sheet splice. Small
rivets, namely 1/16 and 3/32 diameters are hard
to handle and are seldom used as structural
rivets. The common size of rivets are 1/8,
5/32, 3/16 and 1/4 inch diameters. The larger
sizes should not be used in sheet splices
unless there is a backing up structure as the
sheet may buckle under the driVing of the
large rivets. From a structural design standpoint, the optimum joint is one in which the
allowable rivet shear strength and bearing
strength of the given sheets are practically
the same for the largest practical size rivet.


Rivet Spacing. Sheet Edge Distance.


The allowable rivet-sheet bearing loads as
given in (Ref. 1) are based on an edge distance
of two diameters. Therefore in general no edge
distance in a joint should be less than 2 rivet
diameters for protruding head rivets, and 2-1/2
diameters for press and machine countersunk
flush rivets.


The minimum pitch (distance between centerline of rivets in the same row) for a given



size rivet should not be less than that given
in Tables A and B.

|Table A|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|PROTRUDING HEAD RIVET<br>NORMAL MINIMUM SPACING|PROTRUDING HEAD RIVET<br>NORMAL MINIMUM SPACING|PROTRUDING HEAD RIVET<br>NORMAL MINIMUM SPACING|PROTRUDING HEAD RIVET<br>NORMAL MINIMUM SPACING|PROTRUDING HEAD RIVET<br>NORMAL MINIMUM SPACING|
|Rivet Diameter|1/8|5/32|3/16|1/4|
|Normal Minimum<br>Spacing|1/2|9/16|11/16|7/8|


|Table B|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|NORMAL MINIMUM SPACING<br>PRESS AND MACHINE COUNTERSUNK FLUSH RIVETS|NORMAL MINIMUM SPACING<br>PRESS AND MACHINE COUNTERSUNK FLUSH RIVETS|NORMAL MINIMUM SPACING<br>PRESS AND MACHINE COUNTERSUNK FLUSH RIVETS|NORMAL MINIMUM SPACING<br>PRESS AND MACHINE COUNTERSUNK FLUSH RIVETS|NORMAL MINIMUM SPACING<br>PRESS AND MACHINE COUNTERSUNK FLUSH RIVETS|
|Rivet Diameter|1/8|5/32|3/16|1/4|
|Normal Minimum<br>Spacing|11/16|27/32|1-1/32|1-1/4|



In general the minimum rivet row spacing
should be such as to make the distance between
any two rivets in the two rows not less than the

minimu~ rivet spacing for the rivet size being
used.


Splice Sheet Tension Efficiency.


When a sheet is spliced by means of rivets
or bolts it means the sheet is weakened since
the rivet holes cut away a part of the sheet
material. The ratio of the tension strength of
the spliced sheet to the unspliced sheet is
called the sheet tension efficiency of the
joint. If the minimum rivet spacing is used
and only one row of rivets the sheet efficiency
will be around 70 to 75 percent. The designer
should strive for a higher efficiency.


**Dl.** 24 Illustrative Problems Involving Use of Rivets.


PROBLEM 1. Horn Connection to Torque Tube.



![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-950-3.png)
![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-951-full.png)

Fig. Dl.36 illustrates a rUdder horn
attachment to the lower end of a rUdder torque
tube for a small airplane. The horn is
fastened to the tube by two collars riveted to
the horn and likewise to the tUbe. The design
load cable pull is 400 lb. which includes a
fitting factor of safety of 1.15. The rivet
material is 2117-T3 aluminum alloy. The horn
and tube is 2024-T3 aluminum alloy. The margin
of safety for the riveted connection will be
calculated.


Solution:

The horizontal cable pUll of 400 lb. can
be replaced by an equivalent force system at
the centerline of the tUbe, consisting of a
torsional moment of 400 x 5 = 2000 in.lb., and
a horizontal 400 lb. force.


Consider attachment of collars to horn:

6 - 1/8 diameter rivets are usee in double
shear.


Load per rivet due to torque = 2000/6 x 1
= 334 lb. (Rivet arm is 1 inch).


Load per rivet due to horizontal force
= 400/6 = 67 lb.


Resultant load on most critical rivet is
334 + 67 = 401 lb.


From Table Dl.5 the single shear strength
of a 1/8 diameter rivet of 2117-T3 material is
388 lb. Since the rivets are in double shear
the shear strength of one rivet would be 2 x
388 = 776 lb. Referring to the table at the
bottom of Table Dl.5, we find a rivet factor
of .935 to apply for a 1/8 rivet on .063 sheet
thickness. Therefore rivet strength is .935 x
766 = 718 lb.


M.S. in rivet shear = (718/401) - 1 = .79


Each rivet bears on two collars each of which
is .063 in thickness. The bearing strength of
a 1/8 rivet on .063 2024-T3 alQmlnum alloy
material is obtained from Tables Dl.9 and Dl.g.


From Table Dl.9, bearing strength of 1/8
diameter rivet on .063 sheet based on an
allowable bearing stress Fbr = 100,000 is 810
lb. Then referring to Table D1. 8 for 2024-T3
material and e/D of 1.5, we find a correction
factor of .98. Thus bearing strength is .98 x
810 = 794 lb. Since each rivet bears on two
collars, the bearing strength for one rivet =
2 x 794 = 1588 lb.


M.S. = 1588/401 = 2.96



**Dl.** **19**


Consider attachment of collars to horn.


10 - 5/32 diameter rivets are used.


Load on each rivet due to torque = 2000/10
x .6 = 334 lb. The horizontal force of 400 lb.
can be taken by direct bearing between collars
and tube.


The rivets are in single shear. The single
shear strength of a 5/32 rivet from Table Dl.5
= 596 x .996 = 594 lb. (The value of .996 is
the correction from middle table of Table D1.·5.


M.S. = (594/334) -1 = .78


Bearing strength on .049 tube wall from
Table Dl.9 for .050 thickness and Fbr = 100,000
is 795 lb. correcting to .049 = (.049/.050) 795
= 780. For 2024-T3 tube material and e/D = 2.0
we obtain a material factor of 1.24. Therefore
bearing strength of one rivet on tube wall is
1.84 x 780 = 967 lb.


M.S. = (967/334) -1 = 1.9


PHOBLEM 2.


Fig. Dl.37 shows a plate fitting att~ched
to a double channel section by 6 - 1/4 diameter
rivets. ThB design fitting loads are shown in
the figure. The riveted connection will be
checked for strengtJl under the given design
fitting loads.


Solution:

The given force system will be replaced by
an equivalent force system acting at the center
of gravity of the rivet group. This force
system will consist of:


**H** **e .** **g .** **=** **8000** **lb.,** **V** **c .** **g .** **=** **3000** **lb.**

NOTE: The values in this table are based on "good" manufacturing practice. and any deviation from this will produce
significantly reduced values.


G Sheet gage is that of the countersunk sheet. In cases
where the lower sheet is thinner than the upper. the shearbearing allowable for the lower sheet-rivet combination should



be computed.


_b_ Increased attention should be paid to detail design in cases
where _D/t>4.0_ because of possibly greater incidence of difficulty in service.

"Yield values of the sheet-rivet combinations are less than

2/3 of the indicated ultimate values.

01.24 FITTINGS AND CONNECTIONS. BOLTED AND RIVETED.



Since rivets are same size, all rivets are
assumed to share equally in resisting Hand Y
loads.


Load on each rivet due to Hc .g. = 8000/6 = 1333
acting in H direction and to the right. Load
on each rivet due to Y c . g • = 3000/6 = 500 lb.
acting down.


From equ8.l:;ion (15), the load on a rivet
due to Mc • g • on rivet group equals F = Mr/I.


I = Lr 2 = 1.625 2 X 4 + 0.625 2 X 2 = 11.4


Consider rivet marked c;


r = 1.625 = arm to c.g. of bolt group.


Fc = Mr/I = (9000 x 1.625)11.4 = 1280 lb.


Since rivets b, d and e are the same
distance as rivet c from the c.g., the moment
load on these bolts will also equal 1280. Fig.
Dl.38 shows the H, Y, and M loads on the rivets
b, c, d and e. Since the arm r to the rivets
f and g is only 0.625, the load due to moment
will be considerably smaller and thus these
rivets will not be critical. Observation of
Fig. Dl.38 shows rivet c is the rivet with the
largest reSUltant load.

Rc = vZ F H 2 + LFy 2


LFH = 1333 + 1280 x 1.5/1.625 = 2513 lb.


LFy = -500   - 1280 x 0.625/1.625 =- 992


Hence, R = /2513 2 + 992 2 = 2700 lb.


The rivets are in double shear. Rivet
material is 2117-T31.


From Table Dl.5, single shear value
1760 lb. or double shear strength = 3520 lb.


Bearing strength of 1/4 rivet on the.071
2024-T3 clad channel section from Tables Dl.9
and Dl.8 is 1825 x 1.20 = 2190. Since rivet
bears on two channels, bearing strength of
one rivet = 2 x 2190 = 4380 lb. Rivet shear
is critical.


M.S. = (3520/2700) - 1 = .30


As a problem for the reader, change rivets
f and g to 3/16 diameter and determine whether
rivet attachment still shows a positive margin
of safety (use equation 16).

Solution:

As an analysis unit, a Width of sheet equal
to the rivet pitch of 1 inch will be used. Thus
load on 1 inch unit = 1000 lb.


Check Tension in Sheet at Section Through Holes.


Pt(allow) = A Ftu


A = net area = (1- .159) .04 = .0336


(.159 = drill diameter for 5/32 rivet,
Table D1.6)


Ftu for 2024-T3 clad = 60,000 psi.


Pt(allow) = .0336 x 60000 = 2016 lb.


M.S. = (2016/1000)-1 = 1.01


Check Shear of Rivets.


Rivets are in single shear and two rivets
act in the 1 inch unit which was assumed. From
Table Dl.5, single shear strength for 5/32,
2117-T3 rivet is 596 lb. The strength factor
middle table of Table Dl.5 for .04 sheet
thickness is .964. Thus for two rivets the
shear strength is 2 x .964 x 596 = 1150 lb.


M.S. = (1150/1000) -1 = .15



2117-T3 material and of the protruding head
type.


The ultimate design tension load in the
sheet inclUding a 1.15 fi tt ing factor of safety
is 1000 Ib./inch. The limit fitting load is
2/3 x 1000 = 667 Ib./in.


The margin of safety of the sheet splice
will be determined.

PROBLEM 3. Check Bearing of Rivets on .04 Sheet.



Fig. Dl.39 shows a lap joint involving
two rows of rivets as shown. Sheet material is
2024-T3 clad, and rivets are 5/32 diameter and



From Table Dl.9, the ultimate bearing
strength based on Fbr of 100,000 psi for 5/32
rivet on .04 sheet = 636 lb. Then referring to


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-957-full.png)

D1. 25



Table Dl.8 for 2024-T3 clad material and an
_e/D_ ratio of 2.0, we find correction factor K
= 1.14. Therefore rivet bearing strength is
1.14 x 636 x 2 = 1450 lb.


M.S. = _(1450/1000)_ -1 = .45


Check Rivet Shear Out.


Since edge distance is _5/16_ in. or _e/D_ _=_
2.0, shear out strength is satisfactory.

PROBLEM 4.


Assume rivets are changed to the solid
100 [0] dimpled type. What would be the M.S. for
the rivets. Referring to Fig. Dl.27, we find
the sheet thicknesses are such as to prevent
double dimpling. From Table Dl.ll and Dl.12,
we obtain the ultimate and yield strength of a
_5/32_ rivet on .04 sheet as 635 and 506 Ibs.
respectively.


Whence, Ultimate M.S. = _(2x635/1000)_ -1 = .27

Yield M.S. = (2 x _506/667)_      - 1 = .49


NOTE: In checking tensile strength of sheet
through hole section, the drill size for
dimpled rivets is slightly larger than
for protruding head type.


PROBLEM 5.


This is a typical problem involving the
rivet loads in a sheet-stringer type of
construction as illustrated in Fig. D1.40.
Before the rivet size and spacing at the points
(1) to (10) can be determined, the rivet loads
at these points must be known. The shear flow
in direction and magnitude on the webs and skin
are shown on the figure and are in Ibs. per
inch. These values represent the results in
one of the flight conditions. The structural
designer must look at all the shear flows in
the various flight and landing conditions in
order to obtain the critical rivet loads. It
is assumed the shear flows as shown include
any diagonal tension effect in the various
sheet panels.


The rivet loads in Ibs./in. at rivet lines
1 to 10 will be as follows:

Rivet line (1). Since .05 vertical web ends
at point (1), the shear flow of 1075 Ibs./in.
in the vertical web must obViously be reacted
by the rivets in rivet line (1), thus load on
rivet line (1) is 1075 Ibs./in.


Rivet line (2). By the same reasoning since
skin ends at point (2), the load on rivet line
(2) equals shear flow in panel 2-3 or 575
Ibs./in.



Rivet line (3). The skin is continuous over
stringer at point (3). Sketch (a) shows a free
body of the skin and stringer at point (3).
Since the summation of the forces parallel to
the stringer must equal zero, it is observed
that the load transferred to the stringer is
150 Ibs./in.


Rivet lines (4) and (5). Since the sheets end
over the stringer, the load in rivet lines (4)
and (5) are 425 and 275 Ibs./in. respectively.


Ri vet line (6). Rivet load = 275 - 125 =
150 Ibs./in.


Rivet line (7). The skin is lap spliced over
the stringer at pOint 7. Sketch (b) shows a
free body. The load produced on the stringer
is 150 from eqUilibrium. Thus the worst shear
load on the rivet is 150 Ibs./in. which is
greater than the shear on another cross-section
of the rivet which equals 125 Ibs./in. as the
shear flow in panel 6-7.


Rivet Load at (8) = 175 - 25 = 150 Ibs./in.
Rivet Load at (9) = 175 Ibs./in.
Rivet Load at (10) = 675 Ibs.!in.


D1. 25 Rivets in Tension.


Great judgment should be used in using
rivets "N· ever in use tension. a rIvet in There tension." is a general If this saying re- '
quirement was strictly followed, it would be
difficult to design a conventional airplane.
For example, the skin on the upper surface of
the wing, due to the upward suction air forces
places the rivets that hold the skin to the
stringers and ribs in tension, however these
tension loads in most cases are relatively
small.


The following general criteria apply
relative to rivets in tension.

NOTE: The values in this table are based on "good" manufacturing practice and
any deviation from this will produce significantly reduced values.

_a_ These allowables apply to double dimpled sheets and to the upper sheet dimpled
into a machine-countersunk lower sheet. Sheet gage is that of the thinnest sheet



for double dimpled joints and of the upper dimple sheet for dimpled, machine-countersunk joints. The thickness of the machine-countersunk sheet must be at least 1
tabulated gage thicker than the upper sheet. In no case shall allowables be obtained
by extrapolation for skin gages other than those shown.

**CHAPTER** **D2**

**WELDED CONNECTIONS**



In general avoid welds in tension since
they produce a weakening effect. In some
connections it is difficult to avoid all
tension loads on welds, thus weld stresses
should be kept low and if possible
incorporate a fishmouth joint or finger
patch to put part of weld in shear.


A weld should not encircle a tube in a
plane perpendicular to the tube length.
Standard splices or joints for overlapping
tUbes, and end socket fittings in tubes
have been developed, which require no
strength check. These are the diagonal
weld and the fishmouth welds as illustrated
in Fig. D2.1.


Tapered gusset plates should be incorporated
in all important welded joints to insure
gradual change in stress intensity in
members. These gussets lessen the danger
of fatigue failure by reducing stress
intensity.



D2. 1 Introduction.


Since the overall structure of an airplane,
missile or space vehicle cannot be fabricated
as a single continuous unit, such structures
involve many structural parts which must be
fastened together. For certain materials and
types of structural units, welding plays an
important role in joining or connecting
structur3,l units. Research is constantly
going on to develop better welding machines
and welding techniques and also to develop new
materials that can be welded wi tllOut producing
a detrimental strength influence on the base
or unwelded material. A fair size book could
be written on the subject of welding and design
for welding. This brief chapter can only be a
brief introduction to the sUbject.


D2. 2 Gas Welding.


There are two types of gas welding, namely,
oxyacetylene and oxyhydrogen. Practically all
gas welding in aircraft work is oxyacetylene.
Some welders prefer the oxydrogen flame in
welding aluminum alloys because the flame is
not so hot. The major aircraft structural units
in which gas welding plays an important part
are welded steel tubular fuselages, engine
mounts, and landing gears and the attachment
of plate and machined fittings to such
structLrre.


D2.3 General Notes on the Practical Design of
Welded Joints.


The designer of welded structures in steel
can greatly help the welder obtain good joints
or connections by adherring to the following
general rules.

D2.2 WELDED CONNECTIONS


(12) Standard aircraft bolts should not be
welded in place since they are made of
nickel steel and therefore cannot be
satisfactorily welded. Since standard
aircraft nuts are made of 1025 steel they
can be welded in place if desired.


D2.4 General Types of Welded Steel Fitting Units.



Fig. D2.2 taken from aircraft tubing handbook of the Summerill Tubing Company smmnarizes
the co®non types of tube terminals and discusses their structural merit. Fig. D2.3
illustrates the conventional concentric butt
welded fuselage joint which tests show is
satisfactory where vibration is not present.
Tests have shown that the fatigue strength of
a welded joint as illustrated in Fig. D2.3
when the members are subjected to reverse
bending is reduced considerably, thus it is
common practice to add additional joint reinforcement such as finger plates or insert
gussets as illustrated in Figs. D2.4 and D2.5
to joints subjected to vibration.


Figs. D2.6 to D2.8 illustrate methods of
splicing a longeron at a truss joint. The
vertical and diagonal members strengthen the
butt weld on the spliced member.


Figs. D2.9 and D2.10 illustrate fitting
plate attachments to tUbes. Except for light
fitting loads, the fitting plate should extend
through to both sides of tUbe or to the adjoining members. The fitting type illustrated in
Fig. D2.11 is only used for secondary conditions
where loads or plate are relatively light.


Since eccentricity of member forces on a
joint produce bending in the connecting members
which may lower the fatigue strength of the
joint, such cases of joint eccentricity as
illustrated in Figs. D2.12 to D2.14 should be
eliminated in joint design.


D2. 5 Electric Arc Welding.


This method of welding is based upon the
heat generated in an electric arc. Arc welding
to a limited extent has been used for many
years in aircraft fabrication. No doubt the
flexibility and general all around good results
obtained with gas welding retarded its
extensive use, however in recent years its use
is increasing rapidly as its economies and advantages become apparent to the designer. In
arc welding the applied heat is more concentrated and quicker welding results with less
expansion and warning as compared to gas
welding. In the design of tubular joints, care
should be taken to make all welds as accessible
as possible. To secure proper stress distribution in arc welded joints the designer should
follow the reco~~endations as illustrated in
Figs. D2.15 to D2.18.

The fact that less expansion and warping
takes place since the heat is concentrated
makes it possible to hold to closer tolerances
on parts requiring machining after welding an
allowance of 1/16 inch is generall sufficient
on most assemblies. Electric welding permits
welding of thin sheets as low as .016 inch
thickness.

D2.4 WELDED CONNECTIONS



due to cold working is lost in the material adjacent to the weld which lowers strength to a
small degree. Welding, however, does produce a
more brittle material which has lower resistance to shock, vibration and reversal of stress,
thus it is customary to assume an efficiency of
weld joints less than 100 percent.


Table D2.1 gives the allowable ultimate
tensile stress for alloy steels for material
adjacent to weld when structure is welded after
heat treatment.

|Table D2. 1 (Ref. 1) Allowable Ultimate Tensile Stresses Near Fusion Welds in 4130, 4140, 4340, or 8630 Steelsa|Col2|

a Welded after heat treatment or normalized after weld.
b Gussets or plate inserts considered 0 [0] taper with center
line.


For welding members subjected to bending,
the allowable modulus of rupture for alloy
steels when welded after heat-treatment should
not exceed the following as specified in
(Ref. 1).


For tapered joints of 30 [0] or less, use
modulus of rupture Fb equivalent to that for
steel having Ftu = 90000 psi.


For all other types of welds, use Fb equal
to .9 of that for steel haVing Ftu = 90000 psi.
Chapter C4 gives chart for determining the
modulus of rupture Fb for alloy steel tubes
and Chapter C3 gives a procedure of determining
Fb for other shapes subjected to bending.


strength of Base Material When Structure is
Heat-Treated After Welding.


Reference (1) says that for materials
heat-treated after welding, the allowable
stresses in the parent material near a welded
joint may equal the allowable stress for the
heat-treated material, in other words, no
reduction for welding·. However, it is good
design practice to be conservative on welded
joints, thus a reduction of 10 to 20 percent
of the heat-treated properties is often used
in calculating the tensile or bending strength
in the member adjacent to the weld.


D2.6 Weld-Metal Allowable Stress.


Table D2.2 (from Ref. 1) gives the allowable weld-metal strengths for the various
steels. These design allowable stresses for
the weld material are based on 85 percent of



the respective minimum tensile ultimate test
values.

D2.7 Allowable Load for Welded Seams.


The allowable load on a welded seam can be
calculated by the following equation:

Fa = F su or FST (Lt) - - - - - - - - - - - D2.1


where,


Fa = allowable load in Ibs.
F su and FST from Table D2.8
L = length of welded seams in inches
t = thickness of thinnest material joined by
the weld in the case of lap welds between
two steel plates or between plates and
tUbes. (inches)
t = average thickness in inches of the weld
metal in the case of tube assemblies, but
not to be greater than 1.25 times the
thickness of the welded stock.


D2. 8 Brazing.


Brazing as applied to aircraft work is a
process of uniting steel parts by means of a
copper-zinc mixture, which is applied by melting
with an air-gas flame or by dipping into the
molten mixture. The strength of the joint
depends on the surface areas of contact and the
clearance between the parts to be joined.


Although the brazing mixture may develop a
shearing strength of 40000 psi, a general allowable value of 10000 psi is used in aircraft work
because many factors, particularly the skill of
the workman, effects the strength of a brazed
joint.


The requirements of the procuring or
government agencies should be noted before using
brazing in aircraft work.

02.9 Welding of Aluminum Alloys.


The heat-treatable alloys, commonly
referred to as the strength alloys, such as
2014, 2024, 7075, cannot be welded with the
oxyacetylene torch Without destroying their
mechanical properties, which are not restored
even if heat-treated after welding. These
alloys are generally classed as UITweldable.
Constant research is Going on to develop
aluminum alloys that have relatively high
strength which c~n be welded without appreciable
decrease of the strength properties. A recent
development by the Aluminum Company of America
is a new alloy designated X7005, which develops
high strength after weldi~g.


The strain-hardened alloys, namely, 1100
and 3003, are readily joined by gas welding.
Either aa oxyacetylene, or an oxyhydrogen flame
is used and sheet thicknesses as low as .020
are successfully welded. It is common practice
to use these materials in welded fuel or oil
tank for aircraft.

PHOBL~ 1. Fig. D2.19 shows two plates welded
together to form a lap joint. The material is

This is conservative since weld does not
extend across the plate, thus any decrease of
tensile strength properties should be less than
that assumed above.

Fig. 02.20



Fig. D2.20 shows a gusset plate inserted
between the ends of two tubes of a truss. The
gusset is used as a fitting to take the pull
from a 3/16 diameter steel tie rod. Determine
the margin of safety of connection of gusset to
tubes. All material steel, Ftu = 95000.


Resolving the Wire pull into components
parallel to the tUbes, we obtain P = 2100 x sin

~50 = 1480 x 1.2 (fitting factor) = 1780 lb.
The allowable weld load is governed by thinnest
material or .049 of the vertical tUbe.


P a = F su Lt

= 43000 x 1.125 x .049 = 2370 lb.

M.S. = (2370/1780) - 1 = .33



PROBLEM 3.

Fig. 02.19



From equation D2.1,


P a = F su Lt


F su from Table D2.2 = 43000


L = total weld seam length = 2 x 1 = 2 in.


t **=** **.065**


Pa = 43000 x 2 x .065 = 5580

M.S. = (5850/5000) - 1 = .11


Tensile strength of .065 plate using a
reduced allowable stress due to welding of
80000 as per Table D2.1, gives


Pa = 1 x .065 x 80000 = 5200 lb.



In general welded fittings involving plates
and tubes present conditions for which it is
difficult to determine the actual stress flow
through the joint, thus the general procedure is
to make conservative assumptions regarding the
stress flow distribution and check the fitting
units for these conservative assumptions. The
following example illustrates this approximate
procedure of strength checking a welded fitting
joint.


In Fig. D2.21 the fitting plate which is
welded to the three steel tubes is subjected to
a tension load of 14000 lb. as shown. The
fitting will be investigated for possible
weakness.

Solution


Shear Strength of Clevis Pin:


Load on pin = l40QO lb.


Double shear strength of 1/2 diameter AN clevis
bolt = 2 x 14722 = 29444. M.S.=(294444/l4000)
- 1 = 1.1


Bearing of Clevis Bolt on Bushing:



Bearing stress fb =



14000 = 59500 psi
.5 x .375



Ultimate bearing stress = 175000 psi. Thus a
large margin of safety is available to take
care of wear due to slight rotation or shock.


Bearing Stress Bushing on Lug:


14000
f b = .625 x .375 = 59500 psi


Allowable bearing stress Fbr = 140,000 psi (See
Cha;:Jter B2).


The result shows that bearing on lug is not at
all critical.


Shear Out Strength of Fitting Plate:


Shear area main plate = (.75 - .3125) .1875 x 2
**=** **.164**
Washers = (.625    - .3125) .1875 x 2 = .118
Total shear out area = .282
sq.in.
f s = 14000/0.282 = 49700 psi


F su for steel when Ftu = 95000 is 55000.
See Chapter B2.



This value will be decreased to 50000
because of welding effect on material
properties.


M.S. = (50000/49700) - 1 = .01


This margin of safety is conservative since
shear out area is conservative.


Tension Stress on Section Through Bolt Hole:


Area of Section Through Hole:


Main plate = (1.5   - .625) .1875 = .164
Washers = (1.25   - .675) .1875 = .118
Total net area = .282 sq.in .

ft = 14000/.282 = 49700 psi.


Ftu from Table D2.l, allowing full
correction for welding effect, equals
80000 psi.


M.S. = (80000/49700) - 1 = .61

Tension stress on fitting plate at Section
1-1 (See Fig. D2.2l).


Net area = (2.5   - 1.25) .1875 = .235 sq.in.

The entire load of 14000 will be assumed
to pass this section, which is no doubt conservative.


ft = 14000/.235 = 59500, Ft = 80000 psi. o.k.


Check of Connection Between Fitting Plate and
Tubes.


It will be assumed that the horizontal
component of the wire pull will be transferred
to tube (A) by the weld between the tube and
the fitting ~lace. This is a conservative
assumption.


Horizontal load component = 14000 x 2/~=

12500 lb.


The weld length between tube (A) and the
fitting plate is 1.5 inches on the upper tube
surface and 2 inches on the lower surface. To
be conservative, a total weld length of 2 x 1.5
= 3 inches will be assumed acting.


The fitting plate is welded to the tube on
both sides and since twice .065, the tube thickness is less than the plate thickness, a total
weld length based on tube strength is 2 x 3 = 6
inches.


P a = F su Lt = 50000 x 6 x .065 = 19500 lb.


M.S. = _(19500/12500)_   - 1 = .56


It will be assumed that the vertical component of the wire pull will be taken into
tube (B) by the weld along each side of the
tube.


Load = 14000 x 1/V5 = 6250 lb.


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-969-full.png)

The weld length on one side of tube is
0.625 inches long and 1 inch on the other. A
total weld length of only 2 x 0.625 = 1.25
inches will be assumed which is conservative.


P a = 50000 x 1.25 x 2 x .058 = 7250.


Thus even under the assumed conservative
assumption, the weld attachment for transferring
vertical component to tube (B) is more than
adequate.

D2. 11 Spot Welding.



SPOT WELDING



After many years of research and testing,
spot welding of aluminum alloys, magnesium
alloys and corrosion resistant steels has
become a reliable established practice of
joining many parts or units of flight vehicle
structures.


The spot welding process is accomplished
by clamping two or more sheets of metal between
copper or copper alloy electrodes, under
comparatively high pressure and causing an
electric current of low voltage to flow between
the electrodes for a predetermined interval.
The current creates an intense heat at point
_"A"_ (See Fig. a) which melts the metal locally
due to the resistance set up by the sheets.
As soon as the metal is molten to the extent
shown at "B", the predetermined time of current
flow is completed and the sheets are forged
together by the pressure on the electrodes "P".
This pressure depends on the thickness of the
sheet.

military or civil aeronautic authorities. The
following are a few types of structural connections in aerospace structures where spot
welding should not be used.

**CHAPTER** **D3**

**SOME** **IMPORTANT** **DETAILS** **IN** **STRUCTURAL DESIGN**


BY


WILLIAM F. McCOMBS


(DESIGN SPECIALIST - CHANCE VOUGHT CORP.)


03. 1 Introduction.



In the design and fabrication of an airplane the major components receive a thorough
review and evaluation. Many of the smaller
parts, however, are designed at the last minute
and, not receiving so much attention, sometimes
have faulty details. It is these which
frequently lead to trouble in service and in
tests. This chapter represents an attempt to
point out some of the more common details that
seem, somehow, to be overlooked from time to
time. This should be of help to those involved
in designing or dealing in other ways with the
structural components of airplanes or of
similar types of structures. With regard to
specific details, many aircraft companies have
standard methods of design. The reader should
always consult his company's data on these, if
available. In the event such are not available,
the following suggested practices should be of
practical help.


03.2 Shear Clips.


There are hundreds of these in a typical
military airplane. They are used in joining
together both primary structural components
and secondary structural parts such as equipment mounting brackets, etc. The function of
the shear clip is to transfer a shear load
from one part to another. It is not intended
to transfer axial load or bending moment or
tWist, only shear.


A typical example is shown in Fig. D3.1.
Here bracket, or beam, (a) is supported by
beams (b) and (c). The load P is thus "beamed
out" to (b) and (c), passing as a shear load
through the clips into the webs of (b) and (c)
as illustrated.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-972-2.png)


Fig. 03.1


When a significant axial load or bending
moment must also be transferred, additional
members must be provided or the shear clip
must be replaced by a heavier fitting. This
is illustrated in Fig. D3.2. Here a beam, (a),



![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-972-0.png)

**"b"**


Fig. 03.2

is cantilevered off of a heavy piece of
structure, (b). The load, P, passes through
the shear clip as a shear load from web (a)
to (b). There is also the bending moment,
P x 1, to be transferred. Additional splice
plates, "8", are provided for this purpose.
They transfer the moment in the form of axial
loads from the flanges of beam (a) to member
(b) 

Shear clips are usually seen in two
forms:


(a) bent up sheet metal or extruded
angles (the angle being anywhere
from 0 [0] to 180 [0] between the legs).


(b) extruded "tees".


These shear clips are shown in their
"minimum acceptable" form in Fig. D3.3. The

minimum requirement is that each leg of an
angle type clip must have at least 2 fasteners
through it. The "top" of the tee type clip
and its leg must also have at least 2 fasteners
eaCh, as shown in (e) and (f).


The load "balance" of an angle type shear
clip is illustrated in Fig. D3.4. The corner
edge of the clip should be assumed to carry

only the shear bei~g transferred, taken as
1000 lb. in this figure. The net loads on the
fasteners are then as illustrated. Once the
loads are known, the clip and fasteners can
be checked for strength using standard methods.

Fig. D3.5 illustrates what will happen if
only one fastener is provided in a leg of an
angle clip. The single fastener cannot
(ignoring friction) balance any shear at the
corner. In other words, it can receive only
a shear from the web to which it is fastened.
This, in turn, puts a twist, P x a, into the
other leg of the clip and, hence, into the
other web. This is unacceptable, of course,
since a much thicker leg would be needed to
carry the torsion, and an undue tWist would be
present in the other web being joined. Of
course, several fasteners, rather than just
two, may be used when space allows.



Clips of type (a), (c) and (e) in
D3.3 are more efficient than are types
(d) and (f). The latter are used when

order of the clip's thickness or greater, it
can considerably reduce the clip's rigidity and
cause it to function as 2 "one rivet clips"
with the adverse twist effects mentioned
previously. In this case at least 2 fasteners
should be provided on one side of the joggle
in the joggled leg, as illustrated in Fig.
D3.6(b), to maintain rigidity and proper
functioning. The load should be assumed to
be carried by the 2 fasteners above the joggle,
similar to case (b) or (d) in Fig. D3.3.
Joggles are discussed further in Art. D3.4.


D3. 3 Tension Clips


These are also qUite numerous in military
airplanes, being used to splice relatively
light tension loads from one member to another.
The tension clip is a very inefficient type of
splice. It has a relatively poor fatigue life,
particularly, and should be used only when the
load is small and other design factors prevent
the use of the more efficient lap shear splice.


It is usually resorted to when some
structural member such as a bulkhead web or
flange or fitting cannot be efficiently "opened
up" to let an axially loaded member pass
through. It is also frequently used to attach
cantilevered brackets to bulkheads or ribs or
other structure.


Consider Fig. D3.7. Member (a) is, say,
on one side of a bUlkhead and is to be spliced
to member (b) on the other side. There is an
axial tension load to be transferred and since
the bulkhead cannot be cut, a tension clip
arrangement must be used as shown. Angle clips
in this case are illustrated.

An "Unacceptable" the longer leg. This
Type Shear Clip is unacceptable.



![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-973-2.png)

Fig. D3.5

Another type of deficiency sometimes
arises when a minimum type shear clip is being
used. This is illustrated in Fig. D3.6 where
it has been necessary to "joggle" one leg of
the angle clip, say to fit over some locally Fig. D3.7

Simple tension clips are used for
relatively light loads, large loads requiring
a machined fitting of a "bathtub" type. These
clips are usually seen in 3 forms.

To obtain maximum strength and stiffness,
bolts should be used for attachment purposes.

It is noted that for larger clip thicknesses the bolt may become critical and begin
to yield (the same would apply to smaller bolts
than those specified for the thicknesses
shown). This is because of the prying action
on the bolt. Because of the prying action, the
load in the bolt is always greater than the
applied load. Consider Fig. D3.9(a)
illustrating an angle type clip arrangement.
As tbe applied loads, P, begin to "open-up"
the clips the bolt feels an increasing tension
load, Q, and the "toes" of the clip bear down



This prying action is the reason why the
designer should be cautious in using rivets
even for light tension loads, as is sometimes
done. When rivets are used, as in mounting
equipment brackets, it is best to use steel
types and carefully check the prying load
maintaining an ample margin of safety. In
any event, riveted clips are inferior and no
design data for them is given here.


Another point in using tension clips is
frequently overlooked. The structure to which
the clip is attached must be capable of taking
the loads applied to it. These loads consist
of the tension load from the bolt and the load
from the toe action. Several examples are
shown in Fig. D3.10. In these examples the
term "unacceptable" means that the allowable
loads of Fig. D3.8 are not applicable.

D3.4 SOME IMPORTANT DETAILS IN STRUCTURAL DESIGN



structure which is receiving the load from the
clips in order to achieve the full allowables
of Fig. D3.8. The resultant load on the backup structure is, of course, the applied
vector, P.


Tension clips, aside from having a low
static strength and stiffness, also exhibit a
relatively poor fatigue life. If the load is
of such a nature as to occur many times, say
due to symmetrical flight conditions such as
pull-ups and gusts, there should be a large
margin of safety at limit load levels in the
neighborhood of 200% or more. If the load is
due only to some non-recurring type of loading,
such as a crash condition or "jammed" system
load, the large margin of safety would not be
necessary.


other suggested practices involving tension
clips are:


1. Keep the bolt head as close to the
bend radius or fillet radius as is
possible.


2. Avoid their usage, if possible, when
repeated loadings are dominant.


3. If part of the structure is continuous
across a joint and part is interrupted,
do not use tension clips to join the
interrupted structure     - instead a
heavier, stiffer, machined fitting is
required.


D3. 4 Joggled Members.


A "joggle" is an offset formed in a member.
It usually involves one or more flanges of a
member of the "open" cross-section type.
Joggles are quite common in typical metal
airplane structures. They are used most often
when it is desired to fasten together two
intersecting members without using an extra
part at the joint. The joggle is a compromise.
It saves an extra part but the price paid is a
loss in strength and stiffness of the joggled
member. If the load in the member at the joint
is small enough, the saving is justified. If
not, an extra part, instead of or in addition
to the joggle, must be used. A typical joggled
installation is shown in Fig. D3.11 where one
leg of an angle member has been joggled over
and fastened to another member lying in the
same plane.



Some aircraft companies have specific
strength data and practices for the design of
joggled members. This should, of course, be
consulted by the designer, if available. Some
companies use a 6:1 joggle length to depth
ratio, others use a 3:1 ratio, or both may be
used. Strength or stiffness data for one ratio
should not be used blindly for another. Some
of this data indicates that when, in the case
of angle members, the depth of the joggle is
to the order of the thickness of the joggled
leg or more, the loss in strength is about
equivalent to the loss of the leg outboard of
the bend radius. A "rule-of-thumb" design
practice is therefore suggested as follows.
Assume that the net effect of the joggle, from
a strength and stiffness standpoint, is
equivalent to a slot cut into the joggled leg
that extends inward to the bend radius tangent
point. This is illustrated in Fig. D3.12.

Fig. D3.12


With this assumption, the flat portion of
the joggled leg will carry no axial load across
the joggled area but will provide support for
the curved element. The effective net section,
Fig. D3.12(c), can then be checked using
standard methods of analysis for whatever
forces are acting on it. It is obvious that
the net section shown will have little strength
for carrying bending moment normal to the remaining leg. Thus, care should be taken to
insure that any axial loads are introduced as
near the corner as possible - which in turn
means that at least two fasteners shoUld be
used on eachlside of-rhe joggle.


The above approach, considering the joggle
equivalent to a Slot, will give the designer
a much better "feel" of what he is really
doing when he specifies a joggled member. The
basic reason for the loss of strength and
stiffness can be seen in Fig. D3.13.

The axial loads in the joggled leg being
inclined to each other require a balancing
load. Such a balancing load is not available
except as shear in the thin leg and this
results in the loss of stiffness and strength.
If the symmetrical leg of a tee member were
joggled there would be more stiffness than in
the case of an angle, but the same approach,
though more conservative, is recommended in
the absence of test data.


As an example of the foregoing discussion
assume that an angle member is supporting
another member locally which is loaded by the
forces Q as shown in Fig. D3.14. If a skin is
present, as shown, part of the load can be
carried across the joggle by the gusset effect
of the skin. This can be approximated by
using the methods of calculating inter-rivet
buckling of skins discussed in another chapter.
The rest of the load must be carried across by
the net effective section of the angle in the
joggled area.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-976-1.png)


Fig. 03.14


Thus if the total load at the joint were _2Q_
and the load carrying ability of the skin were
R, then the net section of the angle would be
sUbjected to a load P = _2Q_ - R and a bending
moment M = _2Q_ x a - R x b. The stress at the
lower curved edge would be the sum of the
compressive stresses,


f c = Me I Net Section + _E_ ~et Section


For ultimate strength, f c could be carried up
to Fey, conservatively, in the typical case.


In order to realize the maximum strength
and stiffness, the load in the net section must
be applied in the "corner". This is to prevent
stresses due to bending out of the plane of the
remaining leg. This requires that a minimum
of 2 fasteners be provided to receive the load
at the joint. The reasoning here is the same
as discussed in Art. D3.2 concerning minimum
type shear clips, and the fastener loads can
be calculated in the same manner as discussed
there.


If the load is too large for the net



03.5


section to carry, then an additional member
should be provided locally. Two ways of doing
this are shown in Fig. D3.15


Sometimes local requirements are such as
to necessitate both legs of an angle member
being joggled. In such cases it should be
assumed that the angle has no significant load
carrying ability at the joggle. Thus, the
existence of any significant load at the joint
would require an additional member and the
angle should be ended just short of the joint
rather than joggled up onto it.


Add Member

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-976-0.png)


Fig. 03.15


The suggested effective net sections of
members having other types of cross-sections
are shown in Fig. D3.16 where the legs
indicated by dotted lines are joggled. In
general if the joggle is slight, considerably
less than the thickness of the joggled leg,
its effect can be ignored, but proper fasteners
should still be provided as discussed. The
smaller the length to depth ratio used for
joggling, the greater the effect of the joggle.
Joggled members lose stiffness and strength
when subjected to tension loads as well as
when under compression (but any skin present
is, of course, much more effective as a gusset
than when in compression).

03. 5 Fillers.


As the name implies, fillers are used to
fill up a void. It is when they become a part
of the structural load path that they need
particular attention. Fillers also represent
an item that is qUite common in typical large
or complicated metal airplane structures.


As an example consider Fig. D3.17. Here
two tees, "a" and "b" carrying an axial load,
P, are seen to be spliced together by a pair
of angles "c". Since the lower leg of "b" is
thicker than that of "a", a filler is needed.
This filler is part of the structural load

path, from "c" to "a". In this case, to
realize full strength of the fasteners, the
filler must be "extended" and additional
fasteners provided to tie the extended portion
into member "a". If this is not done, it is
said to be a "floating" filler. As explained
later, a floating filler, if thick enough, will
cause a loss in fastener strength.


In the above example let the total load
P be 8000 Ibs. and assume that 2000 Ibs. of
this must be transferred from "c" to "a" by
the two fasteners in the filler area. The
part of the load put into the filler by
bearing pressure can be taken as


tFiller
PFiller = PFasteners x t
+ t
Filler a

= 2000 x .04·~.06 = 800 lb.


Sufficient fasteners should be put in the
extended part of the filler to transfer this
800 Ibs. into member "a".


Thus, whenever a thick filler is inserted
between two members being spliced together in
shear, the filler should be assumed to be a
part of one of them. The part of the total
splice load it will carry can be calculated as
illustrated above. The fasteners can then be
considered as being in two sets. One set must
have the strength to splice the total shear
load from the single member to the combination
"filler plus member". The other set of
fasteners must have the strength (meaning in
shear and in bearing) to transfer the calculated
filler load to the member it is assumed to be
a part of. Another example uses Fig. D3.18.

3. No. Rivets required = 1630 = 1.54 or 2


Thus the 3 rivets are required to transfer
load, P, from "a" and 2 additional rivets are
needed to unload the filler into member "b".
The filler should be extended over "b" and 2
additional fasteners added as shown by the
dotted lines in Fig. D3.18.


Admittedly, the above procedure is
approximate, but it provides a quick way of
evaluating the effect of the filler. When
the filler thickness is less than about 15%
of the fastener diameter, its presence can
be ignored.


The effect of the filler is to reduce
the allowable strength of the fastener. The
reason for this can be seen from Fig. D3.19
where the presence of the filler causes greater
prying loads and hence more tension in the
fastener, along with the shear load.


Any filler in the structural load path
should, of course, be made from a material
compatible in stiffness with that of the



Case I.

Fig. D3.20


Before the cut-out was made the members shown
by solid lines (flanges, stiffeners, webs) are
present. The members lI a ll and IIb [ll] are added to
frame the cut-out, as shown by the broken
lines.


There are 2 ways to determine the loads
in the area framed around the cut-out. The
first is to assume a shear flow equal and
opposite to that present with no cut-out (qo
in the figure above) and determine the
corresponding balancing loads in the framed
area. Adding this load system to the original
one will give the final loads and, of course,
q = 0 in the cut-out panel. The other method
is to use standard procedures assuming the
shear to be carried in reasonable proportions
on each side of the cut-out. The first method
will be illustrated here.


All shear flows are shown as they act on
the edge members (on the flanges and stiffeners)
in this discussion.


If there were no cut-out there would be a
constant shear flow, qo, in all of the panels,
as shown in Fig. D3.21a. Next a shear flow
equal and opposite to that in the center panel
of Fig. (a) is applied to the center panel of



Fig. D3.19


structure around it. That is, one should not
use a soft aluminum filler between high heattreated steel parts or a phenolic or fiberglas
filler between aluminum parts. The need for
fillers arises not only from design considerations but frequently from manufacturing
problems. In these latter cases II m is-match [ll]
between parts sometimes occurs in assembly.
To prevent expensive re-work, structural fillers
must be us-ed to make the spliced area adequate.
In these cases detailed attention is necessary.
In the occasional instances When floating
fillers cannot be avoided, the fasteners should
have quoted allowables well in excess of the
shear being transferred locally, if the filler
is of significant thickness. It is common
practice also to use a bonding agent (glue) in
addition to the fasteners in installing fillers.


D3. 6 Cut-outs in Webs or Skin Panels.


The aircraft structure is continually
faced With requirements for opening up webs
and panels to provide access or to let other
members such as control rods, hydraulic lines,
electrical wire bundles, etc., pass through.
The designer or liaison engineer should be
familiar with some of the various methods of
providing structurally sound cut-outs.


There are several ways of providing cutouts. Three will be mentioned here. These

are:


(a) Providing suitable framing members
around the cut-out.


(b) Providing a doubler or IIbent [ll] where
framing as in (a) cannot be done.


(c) Providing standard round flanged
holes which have published allowables
as discussed in chapter on beam
design.


(a) Framing Cut-Outs in Webs


As an example assume that a beam web
requires a cut-out as shown in Fig. C3.20.

D3.8 SOME IMPORTANT DETAILS IN STRUCTURAL DESIGN



Fig. (b). Since this represents a selfbalancing load system, no external reactions
outside of the framing areas are required.
This is an important concept and the reader
should think about it. The loads in the framed
areas due to qo in (b) are next determined.
To eliminate redundancies, it is usually
assumed that the same shear flow exists in the
panels above and below the cut-out. It is also
assumed that shear flows are the same in the
panels to the left and right of the cut-out.


a) the shear flow in the panels above
and below the center panel must
statically balance the force due to
qo, or


Since ZFt qX(5+3)

q 7/8 qo


b) the shear flows in the panels to the
left and right of the center panel
must also statically balance the
force due to qo'


Since ZF y = 0, qo x12 = qx (12+12)


q = 1/2 qo


c) the shear flows in the corner panels
must also balance the force due to
the shear flow in the (any) panel
between them. Considering the panels
in the right hand bay


ZF z = 0; 1/2 qo x 7 = qx (5+3)


1
2 qo x7 7
q ~~=~~ 8 = 16 qo


d) the final shear flows are gotten by
adding the values in (a) and (b)
together, algebraically. Note that:


1. the shear flow in the center panel
(the cut-out) is q = qo        - qo = 0,
as it should be.


2. the shear flows above and below
and to the left and right of the
cut-out add, giving a number
greater than the original qo.


3. the shear flows in the corner
panels are smaller than the
original value of qo'


This is the way the changes always
occur in the area framed about a cut
out.


e) Finally, and importantly, there are
axial loads developed in all of the
framing members due to the cut-out.



These will add or sUbtract, depending
upon their directions, to any loads
present before the cut-out was made
(as in the case of the beam flanges).
The axial loads due to the cut-out
can be gotten from Fig. (b). Or the
total axial loads in all of the members
can be gotten from (c). These are
illustrated in Fig. D3.22.

Once the internal loads are known, the
members can be checked for strength using
standard methods of stress analysis.


The cut-out could have been framed
Without extending the framing members into
the bay on the right of the cut-out. This
case is illustrated in Fig. D3.23.


Had the 7" deep cut-out been required at
the bottom of bay, the framing could have
been done With only one member (as could the
preceding cases also) as illustrated in Fig.
D3.24. This represents the minimum of
adequate framing for any cut-out. That is,
there must be a minimum of one redistribution
bay on one side of the cut-out and at least
two redistribution bays on the other side,
and there must be the framing members defining the bays. These framing members will
always be loaded axially.


Note that in the previous examples in
Case (b) the sum of the loads on all edge
members (framing members) is zero. No external
loads are needed for equilibrium. This is

always the case when a set of self-balancing
shear flows are applied to a flat panel
structure or to a 3 dimensional box structure
with a cut-out on any side. The reader should
study the examples closely. Although the
method is shown only for a flat beam it is
also applicable to any structure with a cut-out,
such as the box beam of Article A2l.8. This
has actually been illustrated in Solution No.2
of that article and the reader should review
it at this time.


Sometimes framing members for a cut-out
are not conveniently available as were the
stiffeners and flanges of the beam used in the
previous examples. In such cases they must,
of course, be provided.


(b) Framing Cut-Outs With Doublers or Bents


Frequently a cut-out in the web of a beam
must be so deep that it removes nearly all of
the web. In this case the method previously
described cannot be used. Instead the "bruteforce" approach is necessary and a heavy
doubler, or bent, is provided around the
cut-out to carry the shear. This is illustrated



As shown in (a) the doubler whose thickness is
yet to be determined is made to fit around the
cut-out as shown. Reasonable internal radii are
in the cut web and doubler at the corners to
keep stresses due to curved beam bending
reasonable (see Chapter Cll). Attachments are
provided as shown to pick up the basic shear
flow in the web.


The loading imposed on the doubler is
shown in (b), namely the shear flow qo.
Strictly speaking, the doubler should be
analyzed as a frame. With reasonable symmetry
the loading in (c) can be assumed at the
center of the frame. That is, one half of
the total shear, qo x h/2 is resisted in the
top of the frame, one half in the bottom and
a pin joint (no bending moment) exists at the
cut. The bending moment axial loads and shears
at any section of the frame follow as a matter
of statics. For example,


At A-A,


M = V x!!.- = qo h W
2 4
(there may also be a little relieving
moment due to qo)

F z = V = q~h


W
F y = qo x"2


The thickness of doubler required to take the
loads can thus be determined using standard
methods of stress analysis. The doubler
should have sufficient out of plane stiffness,
also, to provide simple support for the beam
web, as discussed in Chapter C10. This will
normally be provided by the thickness required
for strength purposes.


Sometimes the nature of the cut-out is
such that the frame (doubler) can be deeper
at the top (or bottom). In such a case, the


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-981-full.png)

D3.1O SOME IMPORTANT DETAILS IN STRUCTURAL DESIGN



deeper part can be assumed to carry a greater
portion of the total shear, V, and the lower
part a smaller portion. This is illustrated
in Fig. D3.26 where the cut-out does not extend
as high as in Fig. D3.25 and the upper part is
assumed to carry 4/5 of the total shear and
the lower part only 1/5.


The cases illustrated are for shear
resistant webs. If a tension field is present
the doubler must also be designed for the endbay effects discussed in Chapter Cll.

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-981-1.png)

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-981-2.png)


Fig. D3.26


(c) Providing Access With Standard Round
Flanged Holes or "Donut Doublers"


Frequently a cut-out size requirement is
such that a standard round flanged hole will
provide the needed open space and strength.
In such cases either of the following can be
done when the beam is of the shear resistant

type:


1) replace the web, locally, with a panel
having a standard round hole that has
a 45 [0] flange, as discussed in Chapter
CIO.


2) Cut the required diameter hole into
the web and attach a "donut" doubler
(ring) that has the same (or greater)
stiffness in a direction normal to the
web as does the flange of (1) above.


In either case the allowable shear can be
calculated as discussed in Chapter CIO. Th se
allowables apply only to round holes, not to
elliptical or rectangular holes with flanged
edges, which are weaker.


Item (2) above is illustrated in Fig.
D3.27. Note that the hole spacing "b" of
Chapter CIO will be qUite large if only one
hole is present and is not near the end of the
beam. The hole spacing "b" is, of course, used
in determining the allowable shear if no
stiffeners are present.


If a beaded web is cut, a panel can be
inserted locally, containing a hole with a
beaded flange, as discussed in Chapter CIO
and these allowables used conservatively.


If the beam is of the tension field type,
method (c) does not apply. In such cases, a



![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-981-0.png)

Fig. D3.27


heavier frame, as in method (b), that can take
the tension field effects should be used.


D3.7 Special Cases of Beam Design.


There are several cases involving beam
design not discussed in Chapters CIO and CII,
since these chapters are intended primarily
to present fundamental design principles. The
designer will encounter in practice, however,
the following situations which include
ordinary straight beams and beams in the form
of bulkheads or frames:


a) Curved beams


b) Flanges with local changes in
direction ("bent" flanges)


c) Flanges subject to "normal" loads
which tend to bend them.


d) Flanges requiring "stabilization"
against buckling out of the plane of
the web.


(a) Curved Beams


Consider a portion of a curved beam as
shown in Fig. D3.28. The curvature is taken
as constant, as is the bending moment, for
purposes of illustration.


When the outer (upper flange in (a)) is
in tension and the inner flange in compression
there will be a collapsing (compression)
loading on the web as shown in (b). This is
because a "hoop" loading is required to keep
the flanges from moving inward, towards each
other. For a constant load, P, in the flange
and from simple statics.

w is, of course, larger at the inner flange,
since R is smaller, than at the outer flange.


This compressive loading tends to collapse
the web. If the web is also carrying shear,
as is the usual case in practice, an interaction formula which includes compression and
shear stresses should be used to predict
buckling. This is the reason that the allowable stresses quoted for beaded panels and
panels with flanged holes in Chapter C10 do
not apply. These allowables were for straight
webs with no normal loads, as are present in
curved beams.

significant compression in the web, stiffeners

Any difference in stiffener end loads will
be sheared into the web through the attaching
fasteners.


The flanges should be designed for the
axial loads, P, in them. Some allowance for
bending moment, M, (Fig. D3.30) can be made
by taking M as P x e x 1/2 at the center and

 - P x e x 1/2 at the stiffener junctions.
These secondary effects are sometimes ignored
when obviously small, in practice.

"e" is the eccentricity between stiffener
junctions due to the flanges being curved
rather than straight. The same applies to the
inner flange, except that it is in compression
in thiS discussion.


When the outer flange is in compression
and the inner one in tension, all of the
loadings are reversed, as in Fig. D3.28(c)
and (d). The web is then sUbjected to tension
loads and there is no collapsing problem. No
stiffeners are required, other than for the
"normal" reasons. However, in practice, most
loadings are reversible to some degree, and
some compression on the webs will then, of
course, be present.


(b) Flanges With Local Changes in Direction
(Bent Flanges).


This is a special case of (a) above.
Instead of a general curvature the flange has
a local change in direction as in Fig. D3.31.

load in the stiffener is, then sheared into' the'
web. If the stiffener is not provided, some
strength will be present unless the kick load
puts the web in compression, in which case it
will buckle if thin. If the beam is machined
from bar stock the stiffener can be machined
in place. If the beam is "built up" from
separate flanges and web parts a stiffener can
be made up from a tee member attached' to the
flange and an angle member attached to the web
and to the tee. This is illustrated in Fig.
D3.32. The kick load path is from the flange
to the tee to the angle to the web.

The loading shown will produce an up load
on the bolts, putting tension into the leg of
the tee and the stiffener angle. A reversed
loading would push down on the tee producing
compression. The above tee and angle
combination could, of course, be replaced by
a single machined fitting. The important thing
is that an adequate stiffener, attached to the
outstanding legs, be present if all of. the
outstanding leg is to function effectively.


(c) Flanges SUbjected to Normal Loads Tending
to Bend Them.


Frequently the flanges of a beam are
sUbjected to loads which pull outward or push
inward. It 1.s important in each case that the
flange be "backed up" by a. stiffener. The
effect is the same as in the case just
discussed, (b), involving kick loads due to
bent flanges. A similar stiffener arrangement
can be used.


(d) Flanges Requiring Stabilization Against
Out-of-Plane Buckling.


In the cases of flange design discussed in
Chapters CIO and Cll, it was assumed that any
flange in compression was, stabilized, or
prevented from buckling as a column, by some
supporti:ng member. This member was usually
shown there as a floor or a skin to which the
flange was attached. Thus the flange could
not bUckle since it was restrained in one
plane by the beam web and in a plane normal
to this by some skin.


Occasionally, however, this out-of-plane
(normal to the web) supporting member is not
inherently present and must be provided. A
typical example is the inner flange of a



fuselage bU,lkhead or frame (the,outer flange is
stabili'zed,usuailY, bY the outel\ 8k~n). The

It is then necessary to provide supporting
members, as shown in Fig. D3.33, to reduce the
unsupported length and bring the buckling
stress up to an efficiently high level, nearer
to the local cr1Pp:png -strength of the flange.

The supporting member will not be subject
to any appreciable load but it must have
sufficient stiffness to prevent column buckling.
The required stiffness criteria will not be
discussed here but the reader shOUld consult
Ref. (1) or similar textbooks to obtain such
criteria. Since the supporting members are
sized by stiff.ness rather than strength requirements they can usually consist of light",
tubes or intercostals. Their,weight is
usually less than would result from beefing,.up
the bulkhead flange for out-of-plane strength.
The stiffness of the support1ngmember must,
of course, include tb.eendfitttng attaching

be weaker. It is considered good practice to
use rivets along the edge of the doubler,
particularly if the panel is of a tension field
design with its accompanying buckles.


(e) Tension Skin Splices.


Skin splices should be kept to a minimum
number, but they are common in aircraft
structures. The splices of major structural
skins should be given due consideration since
they always contain stress concentrations and
limit the fatigue life.


There are two factors present in tension
splices which reduce the fatigue life:


a) There is the basic tension stress in
the skin being spliced and the stress
concentration due to the holes.


b) There is also the bearing stress in
the holes, due to the fastener splice
loads, which worsens the situation.
That is, the combination of tension
and high bearing stresses in the
skins is worse than tension stresses
only.

as is practicable).

Good Practice
(Holes in Line)



Fig. 03.36



![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-985-0.png)

To keep the fatigue life as large as
possible, the following practices should be Cross-Section of a Double Shear Tension Skin Splice
observed: With Skins Machined Thicker at the Splice Area. (Angle
Shown Due to Wing Dihedral and Thickness Taper. )

a) When more than one row of fasteners
per side is required, as is the usual Fig. 03.37
case:



1. Do not "stagger" the fastener
pattern but keep the holes in
line, as shown in Fig. D3.36.
This gives a lower stress concentration than staggered holes. It
is an interesting fact that two
or mo~e holes in line in the
direction of the load gives a
lower stress concentration factor
than does a single hole.


2. Avoid using more than 3 rows of
attachments per side.


b) When possible use a double shear splice
(a splice plate on each side of the
skins). This is frequently seen in
centerline splices of wing skins.
When the skins are machined or chemmilled they can be left thicker at
the splice to reduce the tension and
bearing stresses locally, as shown in
Fig. D3.37.


c) Maintain a fastener spacing in each
row and between rows of approximately
four times the fastener diameter (the



03. 9 Additional Important Structural Details.


The following list of details is presented With a minimum amount of comment as
representative of "good practice". In
addition to the following list, the details
listed in Chapter B25 "Fatigue Analysis and
Fail Safe Design" should be observed.


1. Avoid mixing hole-filling and non-holefilling fasteners in the same pattern
(i.e. aluminum and hi-shear type rivets
or steel bolts). When this cannot be
avoided, ream the holes for the nonhole-filling fasteners to insure their
picking up load better than a plain
drilled hole, with its "slop", would
produce.


2. When using less than four non-hole-filling
fasteners in a pattern, use reamed holes
to insure a better distribution of load
among the fasteners.


3. When using fasteners in thin sheets
where the value of D/t (fastener diameter
to sheet thickness is greater than 5.5)
determine allowables from tests or use


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-986-full.png)

conservative extrapolations. The thin
sheet tends to "buckle" around the hole
at relatively low bearing stresses.


4. Do not use hi-shear type fasteners in
joints where the bottom skin is dimpled.


5. Maintain an arbitrary margin of safety of
.15 in shear joints for fastener patterns
to allow for uneven distribution of loads.


6. Do not use spot welds to attach buckling
skins to their supporting frames unless a
"one-shot" structure, such as a missile,
is involved. Even in these cases do not
use spot welds on either side at the
joggled area of a joggled member; use
rivets at the joggle.


7. Do not use a "long string" of fasteners
in a splice. In such cases the end
fasteners will load up first and yield
early. Three, or at most 4, fasteners
per side is the upper limit unless a
carefully tapered, thoroughly analyzed
splice is used. Such a design can be
fashioned but is beyond the scope of this
article.


8. Carefully insure against feather edges in
all fitting design. Re-entrant surface
intersections must have their edges
rounded or else fatigue cracks will inevitably begin in such places. Any angle
between surfaces less than 70 [0] can be
considered a feather-edge. These commonly
occur in design if not watched, in
drilling and other machining operation
call-outs.


9. The permanent buckling data presented in
Chapter Cll applies to structures similar
to fuselages where the SUb-structure rings
are closely spaced as compared to the
radius of curvature of the skin. That is,
the ratio of skin support spacing to
radius of curvature is small, considerably
less than one. When the spacing of the
SUb-structure becomes larger, permanent
buckling should be considered to occur at
approximately the same shear stress that
produces initial buckling; that is when
the above ratio approaches unity.


10. Avoid the use of "open section" members
when torsion is present. Open section
members are extremely flexible compared
to closed sections as can be seen from
Chapter A6. For a given torsional stiffness, an open section member will be far
heavier than a closed one. In the example
below, member "b" is 65 times as stiff as
member "a" for pure torsion applied at
each end (see also the example in Chapter



D3.15


**fib"**

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-986-0.png)


Fig. D3.38


A6). For even a closed section to operate
efficiently the torsion should be capable
of being distributed into all sides of the
closed section. This may require a
"bulkhead" type end fitting, or a much
thicker section locally where the torsion
is put in. The action is similar to a
fuselage bulkhead distributing a twist
loading into the skins of the fuselage
or a wing rib distributing an applied
tWist into the skins and spar webs.


11. Compressive buckling does not necessarily
mean failure. It means failure only if
there is no other member to keep taking
additional load. Shear buckling simply
indicates that additional load must be
carried as diagonal tension as discussed
in Chapter Cll. Of course, the members
supporting the web must be able to Withstand the ensuing so-called "secondary"
effects.


When the compression skins of a fuselage
or wing buckle they will carry no additional compression load but the stringers
and flanges are still capable of this,
as discussed in Chapter A19. The buckled
skins can, how~ver, carry additional
shear load through tension field action.
Thus to achieve a light efficient design
the designer should have a thorough
understanding of the factors involved
after members have buckled as covered in
other chapters of this book.


12. Probably the most single important item
regarding detail structural design is the
matter of eqUilibrium. If the designer
will show the load equilibrium for every
part of his assembly, most errors will be
prevented. The majority of all structural
strength problems occur simply because the
laws of statics have not been observed,
and it is usually in the smaller detail
parts that the time is not taken to do
this. It takes a considerable amount of
experience to safely SUbstitute the
"eyeball" for the slide rule and data
book. The beginning detail designer and
many others who have been at it for a
while simply do not have this experience


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-987-full.png)

**D3.16** **SOME** **IMPORTANT** **DETAILS** **IN** **STRUCTURAL** **DESIGN**



in all areas of structural design. The only
safe course in such circumstances is always
to show the member loads in static balance.
for every part of a structural assembly. When
this is done it will also give the designer a
better feel as to how the structure is actually
deflecting under load. This can be of significant help in anticipating problems where
members are joined together and therefore must
push, pull or pry on each other when loaded.

MULTIPLICATION OF' A RECTANGULAR


I1ATRIX BY A ROW I1ATRIX

If the postmultiplier matrix has several
columns, the premultiplier row matrix is multiplied onto each column independently of the
other columns. As many separate results are
obtained as there are columns in the post
mul~iplier. These results form a row.
Example: (3 columns in postmultiplier)

PRODUCT OF TWO RECTANGULAR MATRICES


The operation in this case is a combination of the two previous cases. One proceeds
by taking row one of the premultiplier and
multiplying successively with each column of
the postmultiplier. The set of independent
results thus obtained forms the first row of
the matrix. The second row of the premultiplier matrix is then employed in like fashion
to obtain the second row of the result matrix,
and so forth.

MULTIPLICATION OF A COLUI1N I1ATRIX


BY A RECTANGULAR MATRIX

If the premultiplier (matrix in front) has
several rows of numbers, the matrix multiplication between each row of the premultiplier
and the postmultiplier column matrix is carried
out as above. Each row is treated separately
and there are as many independent results as
there are rows in the premultiplier. These results are arranged in a column,
Example: (2 rows in the premultiplier)

Note that the product of the first row of
the premultiplier by the first column of the
postmultiplier gave the element in first row
first column position of the result. In general the rth row by the sth column gives the
element in the rth row, sth column position.

the postmultiplier.

Matrix Transposition   - [A'J


The transpose of a matrix is obtained by
interchanging rows and columns. Thus if

Then its transpose, denoted by [A _'J_ ' is

When the sUbscript notation is used (see
below), transposition is indicated by interchanging subscripts. Thus, the transpose of


[A ij ] is shown as [AjiJ. This notation is


followed in the text.


Matrix Inversion   - [A-1J


The process of matrix inversion may be
likened to division in elementary arithmetic.
The inverse of the matrix [AJ is denoted by


[A-1J and is computed such that


[AJ [A-1J = [IJ where [IJ is the unit matrix.


Unlike most matrix products, the order of multiplication is immaterial in this case:


i. Only square matrices have inverses.

ii. An inverse cannot be found for a
matrix, the determinant of whose coefficients
is zero. Such a matrix is called singular.
This rule will appear obvious in light of the
method given below for finding an inverse.
One method of finding the inverse of a
given matrix is as follows:


1. Form the matrix of cofactors. The
cofactor of the element in the m!h row and n!h
column is found by computing the value of the
determiuant remaining after the m1h row and n1h
column are struck from the matrix; this value is
then multiplied by (-l)m +n
Thus, in the matrix

the cofactor of the element in the first row,

The cofactor of the element in the first row,
second column is


2. Transpose the matrix of cofactors.

3. Divide by the value of the determinant of the original matrix (conveniently and
quickly found as the sum of products of corresponding terms in the first column of the
original matrix and the first column of the
matrix of cofactors).

The above method of matrix inversion is

on~y practical for small size matrices (2x2 or
3x3). It is presented here primarily to demonstrate the impossibility of inverting a singular matrix. This impossibility should be clear
Inview of step (3), above.

11ethod~3 satisfactory for hand inversion of
matrices of moderate size may be found in
references (1), (2) and (3). In general, hand
computation of large matrix inversions is to be
avoided.


Useful Rules for Dealing With Inverses


While the structural engineer will (it is
to be hoped) be able to delegate the main task
of forming inverses to automatic machine
computation, the following rules and techniques
will prove useful for dealing with inverses in
structural problems.


INTERCHANGE OF ROWS (OR COLUI1NS)

If two rows of a matrix are interchanged
the corresponding two columns of the inverse
are interchanged. If two columns of a matrix
are interchanged the corresponding two rows of
the inverse are interchanged.


SCALING OF A ROW OR COLUI1N

If a row (column) of a matrix is multiplied
by a constant, the corresponding column (row)
of the inverse is divided by this constant.


EXTHACTING INVERSES OF REDUCED I1ATRICES


If one has a large matrix out of which a
smaller (reduced) matrix is to be employed, the
inverse of the reduced matrix often may be
found from the inverse of the original, large
matrix (assuming this had already been computed). Thus, if


row

[ [~t~~j~~]] [ ~] [ k] [th]

has a known inverse


t- k [th] row

and k [th] column, is: I

Partitioning of Matrices


Ma tri ces are sometimes "parti ti oned" into
smaller submatrices for convenience. When performing matrix multiplications with partitioned
matrices these submatrices may be handled as
though they were simply matrix elements. For
example, we multiply two partitioned matrices:

or


Either of these sets of equations could be
correct: _one_ would have to work carefully from
the equation originally defininG the B transpI'
formation, in order to choose between the above
relations. Hence, while the rule can serve as a
check, it should be used as a guide only with
caution.


Check Rows and Check Columns
in Matrix Multiplication


The greatest source of errors in the handling of numerical computations by matrix methods
lies in the forming of matrix products. Whether
the matrix product is formed automatically or
manually it is advisable to carry along check
rows and check columns as ShOffll in the following.
Before forming the matrix product


form an extra row under [A] ' called a check


row. Each element in this check row is the sum
Clfelements in the column irmnediately above it.


Next, form an extra col wan after [BJ .' called a


check column. Each of its elm;:ents is the sum of
elements in the adjacent horizontal row.
ThUS,


1=


(Check row


Now multiply out, treating the new row and
new column as though they were regular parts of


the [A] and [B] matrices. The product matrix


which results will have an extra row and an

extra column.


If there are no errors, the sums of the
elements in the rows and columns of [c] should


c:leck against the corresponding elements in the
extra row and column.
Example:



and [Tk~ is the trans~JOtie of [Ti~ (transposi tion


denoted by interchange of sUbscri~ts).


Remarks on SUbscript Notation


A useful check procedure may be formulated
by the observation that if _one_ "cancels" alike
adjacent subscripts in a matrix multiplication,
the remaining SUbscripts should agree on each
side of the equality. ThUS, in equation (7)
above, all subscripts "cancel" on the right
hand side, which is as it should be, since S is
a scalar quantity. The same procedure checks
the arrangement of equation (8), above.
In checking SUbscripts by this scheme the
order of the subscripts must be (mentally) interchanged in the case of an inverse. For
example,


and


Some caution must be exercised in applying
the simple rule given with this scheme of notation. It is necessary that the subscripts
follow this rule but not SUfficient. ThUS, the
scheme cannot by itself distinguish between
