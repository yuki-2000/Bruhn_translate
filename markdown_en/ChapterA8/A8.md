**STATICALLY INDETERMINATE STRUCTURES**


ALFRED F. SCHMITT



A8. 00 Introduction.

A statically indeterminate (redundant)
problem is one in which the equations of static
equilibrium are not sufficient to determine the
internal stress distribution. Additional relationships between displacements must be
written to permit a solution.
The "Theory of Elasticity" shows that all
structures are statically indeterminate when-analyzed in minute detail. The engineer however, is often able to make a number of assumptions and coarse approximations which render
the problem determinate. In addition, auxiliary
aids are available such as the Engineering

Theory of Bending _(W;)_ and the constant-shear
flow rules of thumb (q = T/2A) (see Chaps. A-5,
A-6 and A-13 through A-15). While these latter
are certainly not laws of "statics", the engineer employs them often enough so that problems in which they are used to obtain stress
distributions are often thought of as being
"determinate".
It is frequently the case in aircraft
structural analysis that, in view of the requiremeLts for efficient design, one cannot obtain a determinate problem without sacrificing
necessary accuracy. The Theory of Elasticity
assures the existence of a sufficient number of
auxiliary conditions to permit a solution in
such cases.
This chapter employs extensions of the
methods of Chapter A-7 to effect the solution
of typical redundant problems. Special methods
of handling particular structural configurations
are shown in later chapters.


A8.0 The Principle of Superposition.
The general principle of superposition
states that the resultant effect of a group of
loadings or causes acting simultaneously is
equal to the algebraic sum of the effects acting
separately. The principle is restricted to the
condition that the resultant effect of the
several loadings or causes varies as a linear
function. ThUS, the principle does not apply
when the member material is stressed above the
proportional limit or when the member stresses
are dependent upon member deflections or deformations, as, for example, the beam-column, a
member carrying bending and axial loads at the
same time.


AB.1 The Statically Indeterminate Problem.
Several characteristics (and interpretations thereof) of the statically indeterminate
problem may be pointed out. These characteris


tics are individually useful in forming the bases
for methods of solution.

[[J There are more members in the structure
than are required to support the applied loads.
If n members may be removed (cut) While leaving
a stable structure the original structure is said
to be "n-times redundant".


-COROLLARY
In an n-times redundant structure the magnitude of the forces in n members may be assigned
arbitrarily while establishing stresses in eqUilibrium with the applied loads. ThUS, in Fig.
A8.1 (a singly redundant structure), the internal
force distribution of (a) is in eqUilibrium with
the external loads for any and all values of X,
the force in member BD.

zero-resultant stress distribution, (c), superposed.


Only the system (b) is actually required to
equilibrate the external loads (corresponding to
X = 0). Note that the system (c) has zero external resultant.


U[J Of all the possible stress (force) distributions satisfying static equilibrium the
one correct solution is that one which results
~kinematicallY possible strains (displacements), i.e. retains continuity of the structure.


ThUS, for example, there are an infinite
number of bending moment distributions satisfying static equilibrium in Fig. A8.l (d) since
M o can assume any value. Of these, only one
will result in the zero deflection of the right
hand beam tip necessary to maintain structural
continuity with the support at that point.

Least Work.



Example Problem A
By way of illustration, the problem posed

Fig. A8.1d by Fig. A8.2 was carried to completion. The

Singly redundant beam with root bending bending moment was given by (x, y, s measured

from the left ends of the three beam divisions)
moment Me undetermined by statics.

-COROLLARY

If n member loads have been assigned arbitrarily while establishing equilibrium with
the external loads, relative movements of the
elements will result, violating continuity at n
points. n zero-resultant stress (force) distributions may then be superposed to reduce the
relative motions to zero. The resulting stress
distribution is the correct one.


A8. 2 The Theorem of Least Work.

A theorem extremely useful in the solution
of redundant problems may be obtained from
Castigliano's Theorem. Consider first the
problem of redundant reactions such as in a
beam over three supports (Fig. A8.2). One of
the reactions cannot be obtained by statics.

Fig. A8.2


A singly redundant beam with one reaction given an ar
bitrary value (R x)'


If the unknown reaction (say that on the far
right) is given a symbol, Rx, then the remaining
reactions and the bending moments may be determined from statics. The strain energy U may
then be written as a function of Rx, i.e.,
U = f (R x )' Next form


This is the deflection at Rx due to Rx• But
this must also be zero, since the support is
rigid. Hence


au = 0 - - - - _ - (1)

Eq. (1) is true for all redundant reactions
occuring at fixed supports. Because it corresponds to the mathematical condition for the
minimum of a function, eq. (1) is said to state

AB. 2. 2 Redundant Stresses by Least Work.
The Theorem of Least Work may be applied to
the problem of determining redundant member
forces within a statically indeterminate structure.
Thus, in an n-times redundant structure if the
redundant member forces are assigned symbols X,
Y, g, - - - etc., the values which these forces
must assume for continuity of the structure are
such that the displacements associated with these
forces (the discontinuities) must be zero.
Hence, by an argument parallel to that used for
redundant reactions, one writes,



![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-174-4.png)

etc.


In words, "the rate of change of strain energy
with respect to the redundant forces is zero".


Eqs. (2), like eq. (1), are statements of the
Theorem of Least Work. They provide n equations
for the n-times redundant structure. The simultaneous solution of these equations yields the
desired solution of the problem.

Fig. A8.3(a) is singly redundant. Find the
member loadings by use of the Least Work
Theorem.

Solution:


The tensile load in the cable was treated
as the redundant load and was given the symbol
X (Fig. A8.3(b)). The strain energies considered were those of flexure in portions AC,
CD and BC and that of tension in the cable AB.
Energies due to axial forces in the beam portions were considered negligible.
The bending moment in BC (origin at B) was

AB.3 Redundant Problems by The Methods of DummyUnit Loads.

While the Theorem of Least Work may be made
the basis of redundant problem analysis, its
direct application by the calculus, as in Art.
A8-2.1 and A8-2.2, is often impractical. For the
majority of problems the work is facilitated if
carried out by the techniques of the Method of
Dummy-Unit Loads.
The following derivation is for a doubly
redundant truss structure. The extension to a
more general n-times redundant structure, in
which other loadings in addition to axial (flexure, torsion and shear) are present, is indicated
later.
Consider the doubly redundant truss of Fig.
A8.4-(a). It may be made statically determinate
by "cutting" two members such as the diagonals
indicated. Application of the external loads to
this determinate ("cut") structure gives a load
distribution, "S", computed by satisfying static
eqUilibrium. At this time discontinuities appear
at the cuts "x" and "y" due to the strains
developed.



The composite bending moments as functions of
s, g and s' were

To compute these and subsequent displacements
the Method of Dummy-Unit Loads may be used (Art.
A7-7). For this purpose virtual loads are placed
alternately at the x and y cuts as in Figs. A8.4-(b)
and (c). From the dummy-unit load equations

explained above in Example Problem #l-A. The virtual work principle and the argument from

Example Problem #2, above. The "u-loads" are Eq. (18) of Chapter A-7, was derived (refer to
loads due to placing a dummy-unit load acting p. A7 .10). It will be remembered that the dehorizontally on the structure at point O. flection was shown to be equal to the work done
Since this load acts on a redundant structure by the internal virtual loads (u-loads) moving
it would appear that another redundant stress through the distortions (n) due to the real

A8.10 STATICALLY INDETERMINATE STRUCTURES


Mathematically expressed these points are;


i . ~RUE = u STATIC + ~=O



where uSTATIC is a u-load distribution obtained

from statics in a simple "cut" structure under
the action of the externally applied dummy-unit
load and ~=O is the zero-resultant u-load

system which must be superposed to give the
true u-load distribution


ii ~ A . uR=O = 0


It follows, therefore, that any set of
u-loads in static equilibrium with the
externally applied dummy-unit load will do the
same amount of virtual work when the structure
undergoes its distortion as would a "true" set
of u-loads computed by an indeterminate stress
calculation. That is,

A8. 5 Trusses With Double Redundancy


Trusses With double redundancy are
handled directly by Eqs. (4). By way of
illustration, the structure of Fig. A8.4, from
which Eqs. (4) were derived, will be solved
for a loading P:I. = 2000# and P 2 = 1000#.
Choices of redundants were made identical with
those of Fig. A8.4a. Figs. A8.11, A8.12 and
A8.13 show the S, u and u load calculations
respectively. x y

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-181-1.png)

We note here the rule by which the degree of redundancy
of a planar pinjointed truss can be determined. For a truss of
m members with p joints, the truss is n times redundant where
n = m - (2p - 3). For a spatial truss (3 dimensional truss)
n = m - (3p - 6).


In the present problem n = 11 - (12 - 3) = 2.


The calculation is carried out in tabular
form in Table A8.2. The member dimensions are
given in the table.

the second degree.

A8.12 STATICALLY INDETERMINATE STRUCTURES



Solution:


The shear flow in the sheet panels was
chosen as redundant. Because of symmetry the
problem was only singly redundant. Fig. A8.19
shows the Ux and qx loadings due to the redundant shear flow X = 1. The real loading in the
determinate structure consisted of a constant
load P in the central stringer alone. The
equation solved was (ref. eqs. (8)).

Solution:


The bending moments at point C in member

as redundants yielding (when cut) the pinjointed determinate structure of Fig. A8.20.

Note that in Fig. A8.22 the unit redundant

having no virtual loadings, was omitted. It

A8.8 Initial stresses.

In a redundant structure initial stresses
are developed if, upon assembly, certain members must be forced into place because of lack
of fit. In some situations intentional misfits
are employed to obtain more favorable stress
distributions under load ("prestressing").
If, in Fig. A8.4(a), the redundant member
with the "x cut" was initially oversize (too
long) an amount a Xi (an oversize, corresponding
to a distortion in the positive X direction, is
a positive a the modified condition for
Xi )'
continuity at the x cut would be (compare With
the equations just preceding eqs. (4)).


a a . + a + a a 0
xO + Xl XX xy


Similarly if the Y redundant member were too
long



a yO + a yi + a yx + a yy

A8.14 STATICALLY INDETERMINATE STRUCTURES



Example Problem 6
If in example problem 3 member CE was 0.01
inches too short before assembly, determine the
stress distribution after assembly and load
application.


Solution:


Data obtained from the previous problem was
substituted into eqs. (10) along with


°Xi ::: _.01" (negative because "too short")


::: 0
°Yi


to give


{2446 X [+] [ 2350 Y] [ :::] [ 2.253] [ X 10] [ 6] [ +] [ .01E]
2350 X + 3039 Y [:::] 2.488 X 10 [6]


With E 29 x 10 [6] the redundant forces were


X ::: 985 Ibs.


Y::: 57 Ibs.


Then, as usual,


True stresses S + Xu + Yu   x y


Example Problem 7
Assume that in the structure of example
problem 5 an angular misalignment occurred between members AS and CBD at joint B such that
the end of member AB had to be rotated 2.7 [0]
clockwise to fit upon assembly. Determine the
moments developed without external loads
applied.


Solution:


The initial imperfection was 0Yi :::


- 2.7/ 57 •3 ::: - .0471 radians

The sign was determined by noting that the
original misalignment was in the negative direction of the redundant couple Y.
The equations used from the previous
problem were (noting the equations there had
been multiplied by L [2] x EI/L [3] ::: EI/L).



If, as is sometimes the case, the number of
misalignments exceeds the number of redundancies,
or if the misalignment does not coincide with
the redundant cut chosen but occurs elsewhere,
one may use the virtual work principle to compute the effect of these misalignments on the
redundant cuts proper. Thus, referring to the
"Virtual work" derivation of the Dummy-Unit
load equations, {Chap. A7) one has


                                -(ll)


where 0Xi is the initial misalignment in the

determinate structure at the X redundancy-cut
due to initial imperfections (equivalent to
initial strains) ~i throughout the structure.


u as before, i& the unit loading due to a
x
virtual load at cut x.Eq. (11) and similar expressions for the Y, g, etc. cuts may be inserted in eqs. (10).


Example Problem 8
Referring back to example problems numbers 3 and 6, assume that member BE is .025"
too long. Determine the initial stresses if
the other membeFs are of proper length an~ no
external load is applied.


Solution:


To employ the same equations as those of
example problem 3, the initial imperfections
occurring at the same x and y cuts used there
were computed, in this case due to the initial
elongation of BE. Thus

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-185-0.png)


Then, use of those previously computed coefficients in eqs. (10) gave,


2446 X + 2350 Y ::: .0391 E


2350 X + 3039 Y::: .0432 E


With E = 29 X 10 [6] psi


X ::: 263 Ibs.

relative motions at the cuts of the determinate
structure caused by the thermal strains and then
restoring continuity by applying redundant member forces to the cuts.
Specifically, consider a doubly redundant
truss such as that of Fig. AS.4(a). After
making cuts "x" and "y" to render the structure
determinate, the application of the temperature
distribution is visualized. Relative displacements occur at the cuts,denoted by 0xT and 0yT'

These displacements may be computed by the
Dummy-Unit Load method as shown in Art. A7.S of
Chap. A7. After this calculation is accomplished, the problem proceeds as for initial
strains, Art. AS.S. Thus, the continuity condition at the cut gives (compare with the equations immediately preceding eqs. (4) and assume for simplicity that the external loads are
**absent,** making **0xO** **=** **D** **yO** **=** **0)**


0+0 xT xx + 0 xy = 0 }

0+0 + 0 = 0
yT yx yy


In a truss, the thermal strains produce
relative displacements at the cuts given by the
"virtual work" derivation of the Dummy-Unit
Load equations (ref. Chap. A7, Arts. A7.7 and
A7.S) as


           - - - - - - - - - - - (12)

where _a_ is the material thermal coefficient of
expansion, T is the temperature above the
ambient temperature and u x and u y are the unit
load distributions due to virtual loads at the
x and y cuts, respectively. The sums in eqs.
(12) are written as integrals rather than finite
sums to allow for possible variation in _a_ and T,
along the members as well as from member to
member. Then the final equations for thermal
stresses in a dOUbly redundant truss become

Example Problem 11
Complete the problem begun in Example
Problem 24 Art. A7.8, viz, that of computing
the thermal stresses in a closed ring whose
inner surface is uniformly heated to a temperature T above the outside.


Solution:


The ring was made determinate by cutting at
the top as in Fig. A7.30(b). The unit loadings
and thermal deflections were determined in the
referenced example. The results of deflection
calculations made previously were

Note that from the last of these equations
g = 0, as it must because of the symmetry of the
ring. Solving the first two equations

A non-zero value of Y would produce a varying bending moment which cannot be because of
symmetry. Hence this result too, is rational.

equations of statics. Thus a certain subset of
the qi' qj are redundants and are denoted by


~, qs' (r, s different numerical subscripts).


When, finally, the redundant forces, qr' qs'

are computed (by satisfying continuity) the true

statics.

(The tabular form of presentation of the
matrix G, above, is used here only to indicate
im
clearly the functioning of the subscript notational scheme. In general, it should be unnecessary to callout the subscripts in this
fashion excepting for the larger matrices, for
the handling of which, the tabular form may
prove helpful.)

The redundant beam problem of Fig. A8.27 is
to be re-solved using the redundant reactions as
the unknowns.


Solution:


The support reactions under the loads P;I.

Example Problem 14
The continuous truss of Fig. A8.28 is
twice redundant. It is desired to analyze it
for stress distributions under a variety of
loading conditions consisting of concentrated
vertical loads applied at the four external
points indicated.

Fig. A8.28


Solution:


The internal generalized forces (qi,qj)


employed were the axial loads in the various
members. These were numbered from one to
thirty-one as shown on the figure. The member
flexibility coefficients in this case were of


the form ai = L/ AE (Ref. Fig. A7.35a). The

coefficients are written as a column matrix below. (They were employed as the diagonal elements of a square matrix in the matrix mUltiplications, but are written here as a column to
conserve space.)

Member loads q3 and q6 were selected as
redundants. With q3 and q6 set equal to zero
("cut"), unit loads were applied successively
at external loading points one through four,
the four stress distributions:thus found being
arranged in four columns giving the matrix

[!i~ (below). By way of illustration, the


loading figure used to obtain the second column


of [!i;] is shown in Fig. A8.29.


Next, unit forces were applied successively
at the redundant cuts "three" and "five" as shown
in Figs. A8.30a and A8.30b. These loads were
arranged in two columns to give the matrix [!i~

Example Problem 14a
Fig. A8.31 shows the two bays of a steel
tUbular tail fuselage truss which is loaded by
tail air loads to be resolved into three concentrated loads applied as shown. The fuselage
bulkhead at the attach-points station (A-E-F-K)
is heavy enough so that it may be assumed to be
rigid in its own plane. Hence, the truss may
be analyzed as if cantilevered from A-E-F-K as
shown. All members are steel tUbes, their
lengths and areas being tabulated below.


Solution:


The generalized forces were taken to be
the member axial loads, these being numbered as
in the table below. Member flexibility coefficients, L/ A, (E set equal to unity for convenience) were also tabulated.

stresses due to load application at the six
points indicated. Flange areas* taper linearly
from root to tip while sheet thicknesses are
constant in each pane10 The beam is mounted

- These are the "effective areas", being the flange area plus
adjacent effective cover sheet area plus one-sixth of the
web area. (The factor of one-sixth provides the same
moment of inertia as the distributed web area).

cessively assigning unit values to the redundants q 2, q 7 and q a. The calculations are
illustrated by the exploded view of the end bay

q2 = 1 was applied as a self-equilibrating pair
of shear flows acting one on each side of the

The reader will observe that the result
displays the "bending stresses due to torSion";
that is, the bUildup of axial flange stresses
near the root of a beam under torSion when the
root is restrained against warping. The solution for application of a torque is readily


![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-198-full.png)

found by superposing stresses for P~ = 1 and
P 2 = -1. Thus, one finds that under this condition there is a root flange load of


q~4 = 3.47      - 2.76 = 0.71 Ibs.

for a torque of 15 inch Ibs.


A8. 11 Redundant Problem Deflection Calculations by
Matrix Methods.
Deflections (and in particular, the matrix
of influence coefficients) are readily computed
from the results of Art. A8.10.
Assume that the redundant forces { qs } have

been deterTIined from eq. (22). The total deflection of external loading points is then
easily computed as the sum of, ONE, the deflection due to external loads acting on the

"cut" structure, [Q rnn ] {P n } (ref. eq. 16) and,


TWO, the deflections due to the redundant
forces acting on this same cut structure,


Thus,


SUbstituting from eq. (22)


{ Om } = ~rnnJ { Pn } - ~m;] ~rsJ ~r~ { Pn }


= ( ~rnnJ    - ~m~ ~rsJ ~r;] ){P n }


The matrix expression set off in parentheses above, giving as it does the deflections
for unit values of the applied loads, is the
matrix of influence coefficients. Let


so that

Matters of precision are dependent upon the
number of significant figures obtained and retained in dealing with the geometry of the
structure and in the care with which arithmetic
operations are performed. In the discussion to
follow it is assumed that all due caution is
exercised with regard to the precision of the
work.

Matters of accuracy have to do with the number of significant fiGures finally obtained in

lation of the problem. The accuracy of the result may be affected by a nQ~ber of factors, two
of the most important of which are discussed
here.
Two factors influencing accuracy often are
considered together under the heading "choice of
redundants". They are:


I        - the number of significant figures
which may be retained in the solution for the
inverse of the redundant force coefficient matrix, [a rs ]' (eq. 21).


**II**   - the magnitude of the redundant forces
relative to the size of the determinate forces.
These two factors are concerned respectively with the left hand side and the right hand
side of eq. 21, viz. -

they are discussed in detail below.


I       - ACCURACY OF INVERSION OF ~r~ ;


THE CONDITION OF THE MATRIX.

The characteristic of the matrix [a rs ]


which determines the accuracy with which its inverse can be computed is its condition. The
condition of the matrix is an indication of the
magnitude of elements off the main diagonal
(upper left to lower right) relative to those
on. The smaller are the relative sizes of
elements off the main diagonal, the better is
the condition of the matrix. A weJl conditioned
matrix is more accurately inverted than a poorly
conditioned one. Two extreme cases are now
given for illustration:

a) the diagonal matrix. Its off-diagonal
elements are zero, so that it is ideally conditioned. ThUS, the inverse of

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-199-1.png)


is easily and accurately obtained as

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-199-2.png)


b) a matrix all of whose elements are equal
in each row. All the elements off the main
diagonal are equal to those on. --rhe determinant of such a matrix is zero and hence its



inverse cannot be found (ref. appendix). Its
condition is terrible. Example:

![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-199-0.png)


In the matrix [a rs ] the off-diagonal ele

ments are measures of the structural crosscoupling of one redundant force with another.
The strength of this cross-coupling is dependent upon the choice of redundants made in
"cutting" the structure to make it statically
determinate.
FOR EXAMPLE, the doubly redundant beam of
Fig. A8.35(a) may be made statically determinate
by "cutting" any two constraints.

The condition of this matrix is poor.

redundants may be chosen simply. In most structures, however, the additional labor involved in
seeking an orthogonal set of redundants is not
warranted.


(2) In choosing a set of redundants which
will yield a well-conditioned redundant matrix,
it is best to make such "cuts" as will leave a
statically determinate structure retaining as
many of the characteristics of the original
structure as possible. ThUS, one may consider
that the structure of Fig. A8.35(d) retains more
of the features of the original continuous-beam
structure than does that of Fig. A8.35(c).


(3) The degree to which one redundant influences another (extent of cross-coupling) can
be visualized by observing how much their individual unit-load diagrams **"overlap".**
To elaborate on this last point, refer once
again to the above illustrative example. The
cross-coupling of q" with q4 may be expected to
be large if their unit-load diagrams are drawn as
below in Fig. A8.36(a). This deduction follows
easily if it is recalled that the dummy-unit load
equation for such a cross-coupling term is of


the form J m"m 4 dx* .

The condition of this redundant matrix is
obviously better than that obtained with the
first choice of redundants. There is less
cross-coupling between the redundant forces.


Thus the analyst, by choice of redundants, determines
the condition of the matrix. The choice may be critical in the
case of a highly redundant structure, for it may prove impossible to invert a large, ill-conditioned matrix with the
limited number of significant figures available from the initial
data. The following statements and rules-of-thumb may be
useful in the treatment of highly redundant problems.


(1) It is always possible to find a set of
redundants for which the cross-coupling is at a
minimum-zero, in fact. Theoretically then, by
proper choice of redundants, the matrix [Q rs ]


may be reduced to a diagonal matrix (ideally
conditione-d) .

(la) The choice of redundants which gives
zero cross-coupling ("orthogonal functions") is
not readily found in general. In some special
structures, such as rings and frames, orthogonal

A8.30 STATICALLY INDETERMINATE STRUCTURES



(4) Combinations of redundants may be employed to yield new unit-redundant stress distributions which do not "overlap" as extensively
as do those of the individual redundants originally chosen.
For example, suppose that in the previous
illustrative problem, the choice q3' q4 for redundants had been made originally, leading to
the unit-load dia~rams of Fig. A8.37(a). Inspection of the diagrams leads one to anticipate
a strong degree of cross-coupling and hence a
new set of redundants is sought. Rather than
return to the structure to choose new "cuts",
combinations of the m3 and m4 diagrams are
looked for which will have less "overlap" and
hence less cross-coupling.
It is observed by inspection that two new
stress distributions-which have the desired
property may be formed from the m3, m4 diagrams
by proper combination. Thus, if one half the
m4 diagram is subtracted from the~ diagram-to



such a way that the product [gir] [B ] does

exactly what is desired, viz., "take one times

second column of the new distribution [giP] "

  - •   - THE MAGNITUDE OF THE REDUNDANT


FORCES; SIZE OF ELEMENTS IN earn]


Inspection of eqs. (14) or (29) reveals
that the redundant forces act in the nature of
corrections to the determinate stress distri

butions originally assumed (the [gim]). It is


apparent that if these corrections are large,
then any inaccuracies in the redundants (arising
from the difficulties inherent in accurately

inverting Cars] or _Capo])_ will have an im

portant effect on the accuracy of the final
stress distribution. Thus, as a matter of
general practice, it is desirable to keep the
magnitudes of the redundant forces as small as
possible.
It follows immediately that one should use
for the determinate stress distribution one requiring a minimum of correction, i.e., Select
as the determinate stress distribution one which
approximates the true stress distribution as
closely as possible.
The rule given in connection with the
"choice of redundants" (rule 2, above) is an aid
in making a good selection for the determinate
stress distribution. If, as suggested, a determinate structure is obtained by making "cuts"
which leave a system haVing properties similar
to the original, the stress distribution obtained therein by statics should be a fair approximation to the final true stress distribution.
However, it is even more important to
realize that the determinate stress distribution only need be in static equilibrium with
the external applied loads and that it may be
determined with the aid of any appropriate



A8.3l


aUXiliary rules, test information, or even intuitive guess-work which leads to a distribution
close to the final true distribution. There is
no need to set the redundant (cut) member forces
equal to zero in establishing the determinate
distribution. Instead, reasonable approximate
values may be employed for them. (The corrections to these values become the unknown----redundants:)
Mathematically, the magnitudes of the redundant forces are directly dependent upon the

magnitudes of the elements in the matrices _[a_ ] rn


or [a pn] on the right-hand side of eqs. (21) or


(30). (The right-hand side of such a set of
simultaneous equations is called the non-homogeneous part.) Thus, the relative merits-orseveral possible determinate stress distributions


may be jUdged by forming the matrix product earn]


with each and comparing results.

Note that a reasonable guess at a stress
distribution resulted in non-homogenous terms
only one-tenth as great as those obtained by

of redundants are correspondingly reduced.


THIRD, as a matter of interest, the true
stress distribution, obtained in Example Problem 3, was used. The result:

It is desired to increase the accuracy of
the calculation in the case of the box beam,
Example Problem 15. It will be asswned for this
purpose that the initial data of that problem
were sufficiently precise to warrant an increase
of accuracy.


Solution:


The first step taken was an examination of
the unit-redundant stress distributions obtained
with the choice previously made of Q2, q7 and q~2
as redundants. The three unit-redundant stress
distributions were represented graphically as in

the techniques presented above.


First, consider eq. (21), written in the
form




[ .0520 .07322



It remained to select a determinate stress
distribution which would reduce the magnitude of
the redundants. For this purpose, the engineering theory of bending was employed to compute
stress distributions satisfying equilibrium for
each application of a unit external load. The
result was (refer to Example Problem 30, Art.

may consist of the sum of several contributions
should qi act on more than one member.



In light of the physical interpretations given

to Cars] and _earn]_, the equation is seen to be


a matrix-form statement of the condition for
continuity at the redundant cuts, viz., the displacement at each cut caused by the redundant
forces plus the displacement at each cut caused
by the external loads, must be equal to zero.
To modify this equation for thermal stresses,
the appropriate expressions for thermal displacements at the cuts must be added. Following
the argument used in Art. A8.9 one writes


where arT is the displacement at the r [th] cut

due to thermal straining in the determinate
structure. The explicit formlfor this term will
be derived below. Rewritten,


(33)


Eq. (33) is a modified form of eq. (21),
giving as its solution the redundant forces in
an indeterminate structure under the application
of both external loads and a temperature distribution.
To derive an explicit expression for arT'

the virtual work concept may be employed to advantage. Thus, following the argument of the
"virtual work" derivation for deflections (Arts.
A7.7, A7.8), the thermal deflection at the r [th]
redundant cut must be equal to the total internal virtual work done by the rt-h-redundant
force virtual stresses (due to a unit r~-re­
dundant force) moving through distortions
caused by thermal strains.
Since the internal stress distribution is
expressed in terms of the internal generalized
forces qi' qj' it is convenient to employ these

q's in writing the virtual work of straining.
If one lets ~iT be the displacement of internal

generalized force qi due to thermal straining,

then the virtual work done by a single generalized force is qi ~iT. The quantity ~iT will be

called the member thermal distortion. The total
virtual work throughout the structure is obtained by summing, giving the deflection at the
r [th] cut as the matrix product


(34)


where gri is the value of the qi due to a unit

(virtual) load at cut r. Note that the term ~iT



Because o.T is desired at each of the rer             dundant cuts, eq. (34) is expanded by writing

MEMBER THER1"lAL DISTORTIONS

It remains to establish the forms for ~iT.

Thermal strains on an infinitestinal element of homogeneous material can cause uniform
normal extensions only, so that no shear strains
develop. Hence only normal (as opposed to
shear) virtual stresses need be considered in
computing the internal virtual work. Note that
normal stresses associated with flexure must be
included. It follows that only virtual work in
axially loaded bars and in beams in flexure need
be considered. Hence ~iT is zero for all qi

which are shear flows on panels or torques on
shafts.


BARS


The general expression for the virtual work
done by virtual axial loads u in a bar under
varying temperature T is

W :: J U _a_ T dx


where _a_ is the material thermal coefficient of
expansion.


 It will be convenient later to designate by qST the solution
to eq. (36) when the mechanical loads Pn are zero, the
stresses in such a case being purely "thermal".

BEAMS


For a beam the general form of expression
for the virtual work done during thermal straining by a top-to-bottom-surface temperature difference OT, varying linearly over the beam depth,
is (see Art. A7.8, Ex. Prob. 24).

where


m = virtual moment (positive for compression on top fiber)

developed by heating the two outside stringers
to a uniform temperature T above the center

Solution:


The panel was divided for convenience into
three bays. The numbering and placing of generalized forces is shown in Fig. A8.4-4-(b).
Transverse members (ribs, not shown on Figure)
were considered rigid in their own planes - a
satisfactory assumption for symmetric panels.
Because of symmetry only one half the panel was
handled. All member flexibility coefficients and

The result compares favorably with "exact"

concerned. The shear flow result is not very
satisfactory, primarily due to the use of too
few "bays" in this analysis.

The beam was divided into four equal bays
giving a four times redundant problem. Four
self-equilibrating (zero-resultant) independent
stress distributions were taken as the unknowns,
these being shown in Fig. A8.46(b). Such zeroresultant stress distributions are the only ones
possible in a structure having no applied loads*.
The matrix of member flexibility coefficients was formed by collecting coefficients from
the several members. Unit redundant stress distributions were prepared, taking q1, q3' q6 and
q7 as the redundants and setting these equal to
unity successively.

A8. 14 Thermal Deflections by Matrix Methods.


A. STATICALLY DETERMINATE STRUCTURES


The problem of the thermal deflections of
a statically determinate structure was considered earlier in Art. A7.8 in non-matrix
form. It should be apparent from the derivation, that the matrix method presented for the
calculation of redundant-cut thermal deflections may be applied equally well to the
problem of computing the thermal deflections of
external points of a determinate structure.
Thus


(37)


where OmT is the thermal deflection of external


point m, and [G mi ] is the transpose of [G im ],


the unit-applied load stress distribution
(compare with eq. 35).


B• REDUNDANT STRUCTURES

In the case of the redundant structure,
additional strains are present due to the
thermal stresses set up; the effect of these
strains upon the deflection of external points
must be included in the calculation.
The appropriate equation is most easily
derived by visualizing the action in two
stages. FIRST, the redundant structure is



A8.39


"cut" making it determinate, after which the
temperature distribution is applied producing
thermal deflections


at the external points (compare with eqs. (35)
and (37) ). Simultaneously the redundant cuts
will experience relative displacements.
SECOND, the redundant cuts are restored to
zero displacement by the application of redundant forces (this problem was solved in Art.
A8.13). The qs are given by eq. (36); they pro

duce additional deflections at points m


The total deflection of point m is then


But


Therefore


or,


(38 )


The matrix quantity in parentheses is the
total strain (thermal plus "mechanical").
----For definite reasons the equation for
thermal deflections has been left in the -form of
eq. (38) rather than the more polished forms
which might be obtained by substitution from eq.
(36), FIRST, the qjT' the thermal stresses, will

probably have been solved for previously and will
be readily available in explicit form. SECOND,
and far more important from a labor saving standpoint, the unit load distribution [gim] (whose


transpose is used in eq. 38) may be any convenient stress distribution satiSfYing statics in
the s1riiPl8St of "cut" structures. One need not
even use the same~im] distribution (and same


choice of "cuts") as employed in the redundant
thermal stress calculation; a more convenient
choice of cuts may be employed: In principle,
any stress distribution statically equivalent to
the unit applied load(s) may be used for [gimr

in eq. (38). (See p. A8.9). -

It is apparent from the above result that
the Simplest determinate ("cut") structure should

adequate.


CLOSURE


The general thermal stress problem is
complicated by the fact that the material properties E, G and a vary With temperature. The
problem created thereby is primarily one of bookkeeping - computing the member flexibility coefficients (a ij ) and the member thermal distortions

(~iT) for a structure whose properties vary from

point to point with the temperature. The variations of E, G and _a_ with T Will, of course,
have to be known from test data.
Two additional complications, not considered
here, are the lowering of the yield point With
heating (and the attendant increased likelihood
of developing inelastic strains) and the phenomenon of "creep" (the time-dependent development
of inelastic strains under steady loading).
Should it prove necessary to analyze for
thermal stresses under more than one temperature
distribution, the member thermal distortion

matrix {~iT } may be generalized easily into a


rectangular form such as


where ~iR is the member thermal distortion as
sociated with force qi from thermal loading con
dition R. The matriX [C ] of member thermal
ij


coefficients consists of the constant coefficients
in the ~iT expressions previously presented, while

TjR would be the temperature associated With qj
for condition R. (compare with eq, (26b),
Art. A7.ll).

(8) For the structure in Fig. h, determine
the reactions at points A, B. Members CE and ED
are steel tie rods with areas of 1 sq. in. each.
Member AB is a wood beam with 12" x 12" cross
section. Esteel = 30,000,000 psi. Ewood =
1,300,000 psI.
(9) For the structure in Fig. i, determine
the axial loads, bending moments and shears in
the various members. The structure is continuous at joint D. Members AB, BC are wires. The
member areas are AB = 1.2, BC = 0.6; CD = 6.0;
BDE = 10.0. The moment of inertia for members
CD = 60.0 in.·; for BDE = 140 in.·


(10) Re-solve Example Problem 10, p. A8.15
using as redundants the two restraints at one end
(couple and transverse force). Solved in this
way the problem is doubly redundant as no advantage is made of the symmetry of the structure.
(11) Add two additional members, diagonals
FB and EC (each with areas 1.0 ina) to the truss
of Fig. A7.85, chapter A-7. Find the matrix of

(12) Re-solve the doubly redundant beam
of Example Problem B, page A8.3 by matrix
methods. The redundant reactions should be
given "q" symbols. (See Example Problem 13a,
page A8.20).


(13) Re-solve Example Problem 5, page
A8.12 by matrix methods. For simplicity, make
your choice of generalized forces including
those designated as X and Y in the example so
that Figs. A8.21 and A8.22 can be used to give
the gir loadings.


(14) By matrix methods re-solve Example
Problem 4, p. A8.12 using 3 equal bay divisions
along the panel (3 times redundant). Use the
same structural dimensions as in Example Problem 20, p. A8.36. Compare the results with
those obtained from the formulas developed in
Example Problem 4.

where ~i is the initial imperfection associated
with force qi' Refer to the argument leading
to eq. (11) of Art. A8.8.


(16) Using the equation of problem (15),
above, re-solve Example Problem 6, p. A8.14.


(17) Using the equation of problem (15)
above, re-solve Example Problem 7, p. A8.14.


(18) Using the matrix methods of Art.
A8.13, re-solve Example Problem 9, p. A8.15.


(19) For the dOUbly symmetric four flange
box beam of Example Problem 15, p. A8.24, determine the redundant stresses q2, q7 andq12 if
one flange is heated to a temperature T, uniform
spanwise, above the remainder of the structure.
