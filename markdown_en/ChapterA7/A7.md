**ALFRED** F. SCHMITT'1}



A7.1 Introduction.

Calculations of structural deflections are
important for two reasons: 

(1) A knowledge of the load-deformation
characteristics of the airplane is of primary
importance in studies of the influence of
structural flexibility upon airplane perform
ance.


(2) Calculations of deflections are necessary in solving for the internal load distributions of complex redundant structures.


The elastic deflection of a structure
under load is the cumulative result of the
strain deformation of the individual elements
composing the structure. As such, one method
of solution for the total deflection might involve a vectorial addition of these individual
contributions. The involved geometry of most
practical structures makes such an approach
prohibitively difficult.
For complex structures the more popular
techniques are analytical rather than vectorial.
They deal directly with quantities which are not
themselves deflections but from which deflections may be obtained by sUitable operations.
The methods employed herein for deflection calcUlations are analytical in nature.


A7.2 Work and Strain Energy.
Work as defined in mechanics is the product of force times distance. If the force
varies over the distance then the work is computed by the integral calculus. Thus the work
done by a varying force P in deforming a bOdy
an amount 6 is
Work = ~ Pd6 and is represented
by the area under the load deformation (P-6)
curve as shown in Fig. A7.1.
If the deformed body is perfectly elastic
the energy stored in the body may be completely
recovered, the body unloading along the same
P-6 curve followed for increasing load. This
er.ergy is called the elastic strain energy of
deformation (hereafter the strain energy, for
brevity) and is denoted by the symbol U. Thus

U = ~ Pd6. Should the body be linearly

elastic (as are most bodies dealt with in
structural analysis) then the load-deformation



![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-132-0.png)

Equations (1) and (2) are equivalent expressions for the strain energy in a uniform bar,
the former expressing U in terms of the deformation and the latter expressing U in~erms
of load. The second form of expression is more
convenient for general usage and succeeding
strain energy formulas will be put in this form.
For a tensile bar having non-uniform properties (varying AE), or for which the axial load
S varies, the strain energy is computed by the
calculus. Thus the energy in'a differential
element of length dx is given by eq. (2) as

Here a double integration is required, the

THE TOTAL ELASTIC STRAIN
ENERGY OF A STRUCTURE


The strain energy by its definition is
always a positive quantity. It also is a
scalar quantity (one having magnitude but not
direction) and hence the total energy of a
composite structure, having a variety of elements under various loadings, is readily found
as a simple sum.

The integral symbols and cornmon use,of "x"
an an index of integration should not be taken
too literally. It is probably best to read
these terms as "the sum of so and so over the
structure" rather than "the integral of", for
quite often the terms are formed as simple
sums without resort to the calculus. The calculus is only used as an aid in some applications.
It is seldom that all the terms of eq.
(13) need be employed in a calculation. Many
of the loadings, if actually present, may be of
a localized or of a secondary nature and their
energy contribution may be neglected.

A7.4 The Theorems of Virtual WorK and Minimum

Potential Ene rgy.
An important relationship between load and
deformation stems directly from the definitions
of work and strain energy. Consider Fig. A7.9(a).

Thus

In words,
"The rate or change of strain energy with
respecttod8flection is equal ~ the assoCiirted
"load". Eq. (14) and the above quotation are statements of the Theorem of Virtual Work. The
reader may find this theorem stated quite differently in the literature on rigid body mechanics but should be able to satisfy himself
that the expressions are nevertheless compatible.
A useful restatement of the above theorem
is obtained by rewriting eq. (14) as


dU          - Pdo :: 0


It is next argued that if the change in displacement do is sufficiently small the load P
remains sensibly constant and hence


dU          - d(Po) :: 0


d(U-Po) :: 0          - - - - - - - (15)


The quantity U - Po is called the total
potential of the system and eq. (15), resembling
as it does the mathematical condition for the
minimum value of a function, is said to be a
statement of the Theorem of Minimum Potential.
From the-r0regoing it;is clear that the
Theorem of Minimum Potential is a restatement of
the Theorem of Virtual Work.
In struCtural analysis the most important
uses of these theorems are made in problems concerning buckling instability and other nonlinearities. No applications will be made at
this point.


A7.5 The Theorem of Complementary Energy and
Castigliano' s Theorem.


Again in the case of an elastic body, examination of the area above the load-deformation
curve shows that increments in this area (called

Any generalizations of the meanings of
"force" and "deflection" are possible only so
long as the units are such that their product
yields the units of strain energy (in. Ibs) Once again for emphasis it is repeated that,
while the complementary nature of eqs. (14) and
(17) are clearly eVident, the use of eq. (17)
(Castigliano's Theorem) is restricted to linearly
elastic structures. A brief example will serve
for illustration of the possible pitfalls.
The strain energy stored in an initially
straight uniform column under an axial load P

In words,
"The rate of change of strain energy with

Eq. (17) and the above quotation are statements of Castigliano's Theorem.
For a body under the simultaneous action of
several loads the theorem is written so as to
apply individually to each load and its associated deflection, thus*:

where a is the end shortening due to bowing.
Because the deflections grow rapidly as P approaches the critical (buckling) load the
problem is non-linear. The details of the
calculation of U are given with Fig. A7.10.
Now according to the Theorem of Virtual
Work (eq. 14)

Therefore

(Euler formula for uniform column). The
correct result.
Application of Castigliano's Theorem,
eq. (17), leads to the erroneous result:


dU = a

The partial derivative sign in eq. (17a)
indicates that the increment in strain energy is
due to a small change in the particular load P,
all other loads held constant. i

Moral: Do not use castigliano's theorem for
non-linear problems.
Fortunately the above restriction upon   - che
use of Castigliano's theorem is not a very
severe one, the majority of every day structural
problems being linear. Castigliano's theorem
is quite useful in performing deflection calculations and a variety of applications will be
made in the following sections.


A7.6 Calculations of Structural Deflections by Use of
Castigliano' s Theorem.
As the examples of Art. A7.3 have illustrated,the strain energy of a structure can be
expressed as a function of the external loadings
provided the internal load or stress distribution is calculable. Having the strain energy so
expressed the deflections at points of load application can be determined with the aid of eq.
(17), Castigliano's Theorem.
In the examples to follow the deflections
of a variety of statically determinate structures are computed. Methods of handling redundant structures are considered in subsequent
articles.

Solution:


The strain energy considered here was that
due to axial loading in each of the four members. The load distribution was obtained from
statics and the energy calculation was made in
tabular form as follows:

Note that in this problem the only use made of
the calculus was in the differentiation. A
simple sum was used to form U, as per eq. (2).


Example Problem 9
Derive Bredt's formula for the rate of
twist of a hollow, closed, thin-walled tube:


ds
Ref. chap. A6.

The strain energy is stored in shear according to U [-] -2 1 _II_ or q "dxd y
This is the only energy stored, secondary effects neglected. Over a given cross section q
is a constant and is given by Bredt's equation
T
q = 2A ' where A is the enclosed area of the tube

(Ref. Chap. A.5).


Solution:


Since the twist per unit length was desired
the strain energy per unit length only was
written. ThUS, assuming y in the axial direction,
no integration was made with respect to y. The
integration in the remaining direction was to be
carried out around the perimeter of the tube and
so the index was changed from "x" to the more appropriate "s". Hence (compare with Example Prob. 7)


The symbol ~ means the integration is carried out
around the tUbe perimeter. Therefore

USE OF FICTITIOUS LOADS

In the following example the desired deflection is at the free end of the bar where no load
is applied. A fictitious load will be added for
purposes of the calculation. The rate of change
of strain energy with respect to this fictitious
load will be found after which the load will be
set equal to zero. This technique gives the desired result in as much as the deflection is
equal to the rate of change of strain energy
with respect to the-load and such a rate eXists
even though the load itself be zero.

An important labor savings may be had in

In the strain energy integrals arising in
this class of problems, the load Pi' with respect

an independent parameter in the integral. Provided certain requirements for continuity of the

For beams of usual high length  - to  - depth ratios the shear
strain energy is small compared to the energy of flexure.
Neglecting the shear energy is equivalent to neglecting the
shear deflection contribution. (see p. A7. 14)

A7.7 Calculation of Structural Deflections by the Method of Dummy-Unit Loads (Method of Virtual Loads).
The strict application of the calculus to Castigliano's theorem as in Art. A7.6, leads to a
number of cumbersome tecl111iques ill-suited to the solution of large complex structures. A more
flexible approach, readily adapted to improved "book keeping" techniques is the Method of DwnmyUnit Loads developed independently by J. C. Maxwell (1864) and O. Z. Mohr (1874)-.---- - ------- That the equations for the Method of Dwnmy-Unit Loads may be derived in a number of ways is
attested to by the great variety of names applied to this method in the literature ®. Presented
below are two derivations of the equations stemming from different viewpoints. One derivation obtains the equations by a reinterpretation of the symbols of Castigliano's theorem - essentially an
appeal to the concepts of strain energy. The other derivation uses the principles of rigid body
mechanics. Based as they are upon a common set of consistent assumptions, all the methods must, of
course, yield the same result.


Derivation of Equations for the Method of Dwnmy-Unit Loads
(Virtual Loads)



I - From Castigliano's Theorem

Beginning with the general expression for
strain energy, eq. (13)



II - From the Principle of Virtual Work

Eq,UALLY, "the so-and-so loading for a unit load

Thus, to compute these partial derivative
terms one need only compute the internal loadings due to a unit load (the virtual load) applied at the point of desired deflection. For
example, the term c\Mjc\p' could be computed in

Likewise, _oP_ _c,_ where Pc is a load (real

small amount without disturbing the equilibrium
balance, the work done is zero - obviously,
since zero resultant force moving through a
distance does zero work.

Consider now the set of equilibrium forces
applied to the truss of Fig. A7.15(b). The set
may be divided into two parts: the "external
system", consisting of the unit load applied at
the point whose deflection is desired and the
two reactions fixing the line of reference, and
the "internal system" consisting of the axial
loads acting on the truss members to produce
equilibrium. These latter are denoted by the
symbol "u". This set of forces is considered
small enough so as not to. affect the actual behavior of the structure during subsequent application of a real set of major loads. This
unit load set is present solely for mathematical
reasons and is called a "virtual loading" or
"dummy loading".


Assume now that the structure undergoes a
deformatIon due to application of a set of real
loads, the virtual loads "going along for t~
ride". Each member of the structure suffers a
deformation denoted by ~ ®. The virtual loading system, being in equilibrium (zero resultant)
by hypothesis, does work ("virtual work") equal
to zero. Or, considering the subdivision of the
virtual loading system, tue work done by the
external virtual load must equal that absorbed
by the internal virtual loads. The work done by
the external virtual forces is equal to one
pound times the deflection at joint C, the reactions R:>. and R 2 not moving. That is
External Virtual Work = l~ x 6
c
The internal virtual work is the sum over the
structure of the products of the member virtual
loads u by the member distortions~. That is,

Internal Virtual Work = Z u.~ .


Then equating these works,


1 x 6 = Z u·~ .

elastic strains due to real member loads 3 then

The argument given above may be extended
qUickly to include the internal virtual work of
virtual bending moments (m), torsion loads (t),
shear loads (v), and shear flows (q) doing work

torques (T), shear loads (V~nd shear flows

the joint moves to the LEFT since the unit load

Example Problem 14
For the truss of Fig. A7.16 find the following relative displacements of joints:


c) the movement of joint C in the direction
of a diagonal line joining C and F.


d) the movement of joint G relative to a line
joining points F and H.


Relative deflections are determined by
applying unit (Virtual) loads at the points
where the deflections are desired and by supporting such unit load systems at the reference
points of the motion. Thus, for solution to

Linear Deflection of Beams Due to Shear by Virtual Work.


Generally speaking, shear deflections in
beams are small compared to those due to bending
except for comparatively short beams and therefore are usually neglected in deflection calculations. A close approximation is sometimes
made by using a modulus of elasticity slightly
less than that for bending and using the bending
deflection equations.
The expression for shear deflection of a
beam is derived from the same reasoning as in
previous derivations. The virtual work equation for the hypothetical unit load system for a
shear detrusion dy (Fig. A7.21) considering only
dx elastic is 1 x o=vdy where v is shear on
section due to unit hypothetical load at point
0, and dy is the shear detrusion of the element
dx due to any given load system or any other

cause.

Method_of Virtual Work Applied to Torsion of Cylindrical Bars.


The angle of twist of a circular shaft due
to a torsional moment may be found by similar
reasoning as used in previous articles for finding deflection due to bending or shear forces.
The resulting expressions are: 
o = J TEtsdJX   - - - - - - - - - - - - - (A )


g = J Tis~    -    -    -    -    -    - -    -    -    - -    -    -    - (B)


In equation (A), for translation deflections,
T = twisting moment at any section due to
applied tWisting forces.
t = torsional moment at any section due to
a virtual unit 1 lb. force applied at
the point where deflection is wanted
and applied in the direction of the
desired displacement. (in lbs/lb)
Es shearing modulus of elasticity for the
material. (also "G")
J = polar moment of inertia of the circular
cross-section.

In equation (B), for rotational deflections,

g = angle in twist at any section due to
the applied twisting moments in planes
perpendicular to the shaft axis.
Angle in radians.

t = torsional moment at any section due to
a unit virtual couple acting at section
where angle of tWist is desired and
acting in the plane of the desired deflection. (inch lbs/inch lb)


Example Problem


Example Problem 20
Fig. _A7.23_ shows a cantilever landing gear
strut-axle unit ABC lying in XY plane. A load
of 1000# is applied to axle at point A normal to
XY plane. Find the deflection of point A normal
to XY plane. Assume strut and axle are tubular
and of constant section.


Solution:


The loading shown causes both bending and
tWisting of the strut axle unit. First find
bending and torsional moments on axle and strut
due to 1000# load.

A7.8 Deflections Due to Thermal strains.

As noted in the "virtual work derivation"
of the dummy-unit load deflection equations, the
real internal strains of the structure may be
due to any cause including thermal effects.
Hence, provided the temperature distribution and
thermal properties of a structure are known, the
dummy-unit load method provides a ready means Solution:
for computing thermal deflections.

Example Problem 22
Find the axial movement at the free end of
a uniform bar due to heat application to the
fixed end, resulting in the steady state temperature distribution shown in Fig. A7.28. Assume material properties are not functions of
temperature.



![](images/73-Bruhn-analysis-and-design-of-flight-vehicles.pdf-148-0.png)

The axial deformation of a differential
element of the upper flange (subscript u) was
assumed given by ~ = _a_ T dx where _a_ was the
material thermal coefficient of expansion.
The lower flange, having received no heating
underwent no expansion.
Inasmuch as a thermal expansion is uniform in all
directions no shear strain can occur on a material element.
Hence no shear strain occurs in the web. The apparent
anomaly here - that web elements appear to undergo shear

deformations ll' = a~ (Fig. A7. 29b) - is explained as

follows: The temperature varies linearly over the beam
depth. The various horizontal beam "fibers" thus undergo
axial deformations which vary linearly also in the manner
of Fig. A7. 29b giving the apparent shear deformation. No
virtual work is done during this web deformation since no
axial virtual stresses are carried in the web.
With the addition of a unit (Virtual)
load to the free end, the Virtual loadings obtained in the flanges were:

A7.9 Matrix Methods in Deflection Calculations.

Introduction. There is much to recommend the use of
matrix methods~ for the handling of the quantity
of data arising in the solutions of stress and
deflection calculations of complex structures:
The data is presented in a form suitable for use
in the routine calculatory procedures of high
speed digital computers; a fleXibility of operation is present which permits the solution of additional related problems by a simple expansion
of the program; The notation itself suggests new
and improved methods both of theoretical approach and work division.
The methods and notations employed here and
later are essentially those presented by Wehle
and Lansing@ in adapting the Method of DummyUnit Loads to matriX notation. Other appropriate
references are listed in the bibliography.

subscript. Thus the system of Fig. A7.31a is
idealized into that of Fig. A7.31b.
With the above idealization an improved
scheme may be employed to systematize the computation of deflection calculations. The following steps summarize the procedure which is
discussed in detail in succeeding sections.

I. A set of internal generalized forces,
denoted by qi or qj (i, j are different numerical subscripts), is used to describe the internal stress distribution. The q's may represent
axial loads, moments, shears, etc. In conjunction with a set of member flexibility coefficients, aij, the q's are employed to express
the strain energy U. aij ~ives the displacement
of point! per unit force at point 1.*


II. Equilibrium conditions are used to
relate the internal generalized forces qi, qj to
the external applied loads, Pm or Pn• With this
relationship the strain energy expression obtained in I, above is then transformed to give
U as a function of the P's.

III. Castigliano's Theorem is used to
compute deflections.


CHOICE OF GENERALIZED FORCES


Consider for example the problem of writing
the strain energy (of flexure) of the stepped
cantilever beam of Fig. A7.32a, assuming external loads are to be applied as transverse
point loads at A and B. The set of internal
generalized forces of Fig. A7.32b will completely determine the bending moment distribution in the beam elements and hence the strain
energy. Set (b) then is a satisfactory choice
of generalized forces.
It should be pointed out that set (b) is
not a unique set. Other satisfactory choices
(not an exhaustive display) are shown in Figs.
A7.32c, d and e. The final selection may be
made for convenience or personal taste.
Note that only as many generalized forces
are used per element as are required to determine the significant loadings in that element.

A7.19


THE STRAIN ENERGY

It is next desired to write the strain
energy as a function of the q's. Continuing the
illustrative example, write


U = ~ JL'M"dx + ~ JL"M"d [Y]
2 EI~ 2 EI ..

o 0


1 L "ydy 1 .. jL "dy

Observe that each of the integral terms in
the above expression is a property of the structural element (variation of EI) and of the nature
of the associated generalized force (exponent on
variable). Introducing the notation


xdx
a~ ~    - _a ...._    Eh r'Y"dY EI..
0 0
r"


_a_ _.._ _[3]_ = r"ydy 0 EI .. _a_ _33_ r"dy EI ..
0


the strain energy becomes


U = 2 1 q .. ~ a~~ + 2 1 q" .. _a...._ + 2 x [1] 2 [q] [..] q3 _a_ _.._ _3_



Equation (19) is an expression for U which
could have been written immediately from physical considerations. Each coefficient aij is the
displacement at point i per unit change in force
at point j. This identity is easily seen by
applying Castigliano's Theorem to eq. (19).
With this interpretation the first term in eq.
(19), representing the strain energy in the
outer beam portion, is written by analogy to

eq. (2) of Art. A7.3 ( U = 2 1 S"L) AE - The remain
ing three terms, representing the energy stored
in the inner beam segment by q .. and q3' are likewise readily written, with proper account taken
for the cross influence of one force upon another (the _"a_ _.._ _3_ q .. q3" term).
Note that

RELATING THE INTERNAL GENERALIZED

considered in this chapter the internal forces
are related to the external loads by use of the
equations of static equilibrium. A set of
linear equations results. ThUS, in the specific
example considered, if PJ. and P 2 are the external loads applied as in Fig. A7.32f, then by

From this last discussion it is clear that

eq. (26a) also may be derived by formulating the
Dummy-Unit Load equations (Art. A7.7) in matrix
notation.
To illustrate the application of the matrix
methods presented thus far, a brief and elementary example is worked with those tools already
developed.

yields


(26)


The steps in passing to eq. (26) may be
demonstrated readily by writing out eq. (25)
for, say, a set of three loads (m, n = 1,2,3),
differentiating successively with respect to
PJ., Ps and P" and then re-collecting in matrix
form.

The matrix ~mnJ gives the deflection at


the external points "m" for unit values of the
loads P and is therefore, by definition, the

describe the strain energy per member, the
matrix of member flexibility coefficients is a
diagonal matrix as above.
Unit load distributions were obtained by
placing unit loads successively at external
loading points 1, 2, 3 and 4 (Fig. A7.36b).

show that the deflection expression, using the
above equation, is the same as the bending
moment expression for a simple beam loaded by

an "elastic weight" ~~ 
In Fig. A7-40, the loading of (a) produces
the real moments of (b). Consider the deflections of points Band C due to the angular

These values of the beam bending moments at
points band c are identical to the deflections
at band c by the virtual work equations. The
moment diagram m for a unit load at band c
(Figs. d and e) is numerically precisely the same
as the influence line for moment at points b
and c.
Therefore deflections of a simple beam can
be determined by considering the M curve as an
EI

imaginary beam loading. The bending moment at
any point due to this M loading equals the deEI
flection of the beam under the given loads.


Likewise it is easily proved that the angular change at any section of a simply supported
beam is equal to the shear at that section due to
the M diagram acting as a beam load.

Example Problem 33.
Fig. A7.43 shows the plan view of one-half
of a cantilever wing. The aileron is supported
on brackets at points D, E and F With self-aligning bearings. The brackets are attached to the
wing rear beam at points A, B,and C. When the
wing bends under the air load the aileron must
likewise bend since it is connected to wing at
three points. In the design of the aileron beam
and similarly for cases of wibg flaps this deflection produces critical bending moments. Assuming that the running load distributed to the
rear beam as the wing bends as a unit is as shown
in the Fig., find the deflection of point B With
respect to straight line joining points A and C,
which will be the deflection of E with respect to
line joining D and F if bracket deflection is
neglected. The moment of inertia of the rear
beam between A and C varies as indicated in
the Table A7.6

Solution:- Due to the beam variable moment of inertia the beam length between A and C will be
diVided into 10 equal strips of 10 inches each.
The bending moment M at the midpoint of each will
be calculated. The elastic weight for each strip
will equal Mds, where ds = 10" and I the moment
-1
of inertia at midpoint of the strip. These elastic loads are then considered as loads on an imaginary beam of length AC and simply supported at
A and C. The bending moment on this imaginary
beam at point B will equal the deflection of B
with respect to line joining AC.
The bending moment at C = 15 x 30 x 15 +
10 x 15 x 10 = 8250"#
The shear load at C = (15 + 25) x 30 = 600#

Bending moment expression between points C
and A equals, M = 8250 + 600X + 12.5x [2], where
x = 0 to 100.
Table A7.6 gives the detailed calculations
for the strip elastic loads. The I values assumed are typical values for a aluminum alloy
beam carrying the given load. The modulus of
elasticity E = 10 x 10 [6] is constant and thus can
be omitted until the final calculations. The
figure below the table shows the elastic loads
on the imaginary beam.

A7.30 DEFLECTIONS OF STRUCTURES



Bending moment at point B due to above elastic
loading = 7,100,000 - .. deflection at B relative
to line AC ~ 7,100,000 = .71 inch
E-10,000,000

Example Problem 34
Fig. A7.43a shows a section of a cantilever wing sea plane. The wing beams are attached
to the hull at points A and B. Due to wing
loads the wing will deflect vertically relative
to attachment points AB. Thus installations
such as piping, controls, etc., must be so located as not to interfere with the wing deflections between A and B. For illustrative purposes a simplified loading has been assumed
as shown in the figure. EI has been assumed as
constant Whereas the practical case would involve variable I. For the given loading determine the deflection of point C With respect to
the support points A and B. Also determine the
vertical deflection of the tip Aoints D and E.



A7.14 Deflections of Beams by Moment Area Method*


For certain types of beam problems the method of moment areas has advantages and this method is frequently used in routine analysis.
Angular Change Principle. Fig. A7.44 shows a
cantilever beam. Let it be required to determine the angular change of the elastic line between the points Aand B due to any given loading.
From the equation of virtual work, we have

Solution:- Fig. A7.43b shows the bending moment
diagram for the given wing loading. To find the
deflection of C normal to line joining AB we
treat the moment diagram as a load on a imaginary
beam of length AB and simply supported at A and B
(See Fig. A7.43c.) The deflection of C is equal
numerically to the bending moment on this ficticious beam.
Hence Elo c = 25920 x 40 - 25920 x 20


or 0c - 518000
-~


To find the tip deflection, we place the elastic
loads (area of moment diagram) on an imaginary
beam simply supported at the tip D and E (See
Fig. A7.43d). The bending moment on this imaginary beam at points A or B will equal numerically
the deflection of these points With respect to
the tip points D and E and since points A and B
actually do not move this deflection will be the
movement of the tip points With respect to the

beam support points.
Bending moment at A = 193420 x 700 - 40000 x

Referring to Fig. A7.44, this expression represents the area of the M diagram between points

Band A. Thus the first principle:- "The
change in slope of the elastic line of a beam
between any two points A and B is numerically
equal to the area of the ~ diagram between

these two points."

Deflection Principle
In Fig. A7.44 determine the deflection of
point B normal to tangent of elastic curve at A.
In Fig. A7.44 this deflection would be vertical
since tangent to elastic line at A is horizontal.

deflection principle of the moment area method
can be stated as follows:- "The deflection of a

normal to the tangent of the elastic line at a
point B is equal numerically to the statical moment of the M area between points "A" and "B"
EI
about point **A".**


Illustrative Problems
Example Problem 35. Determine the slope
and vertical deflection at the free end B of the
cantilever beam shown in Fig. A7.45. EI is constant.

Solution:- The moment diagram for given load is
triangular as shown in Fig. A7.45. Since the
beam is fixed at A, the elastic line at A is
horizontal or slope is zero. Therefore true
slope at B equals angular change between A and B
which equals area Of moment diagram between A
and B divided by EI.

Hence 1 PL2
uB = (-PL. L/2) EI = - 2EI


The vertical deflection at B is equal to the 1st
moment of the moment diagram about point B diVided by EI, since tangent to elastic curve at A
is horizontal due to fixed support.

Solution:Due to symmetry of loading, the tangent to
the deflected elastic line at the center line of
airplane is horizontal. Therefore, we will find
the deflection of points A or B away from the
horizontal tangent of the deflected beam at point
C which is equivalent to vertical deflection of
C with respect to line AB.
Thus to find vertical deflection of A With
respect to horizontal tangent at C take moments
of the M diagram as a load between points A and

C about point A.
Whence

E; (518400) = deflection of C normal to AB.


To find the vertical deflection of the tip point

of D with respect to horizontal tangent at C and
subtract deflection of a With respect to tangent
at C.

A7.32 DEFLECTIONS OF STRUCTURES



A7.15 Beam Fixed End Moments by Method of Area
Moments


From the two principles of area moments as
given in Art. A7.14, it is eVident that the deflection and slope of the elastic curve depend
on the amount of bending moment area and its location or its center of gravity.
Fig. A7.47 shows a beam fixed at the ends
and carrying a single load P as shown. The bend
ing moment shown in (c) can be considered as
made up of two parts, namely that for a load P
acting on a simply supported beam which gives
the triangular diagram with value pa (L-a)/L
for the moment at the load point, and secondly
a trapezoidal moment diagram of negative sign
with values of MA and MB and of such magnitude
as to make the slope of the beam elastic curve
zero or horizontal at the support points A and
B, since the beam is considered fixed at A and B.
The end moments MA and MB are statically
indeterminate, however, with the use of the two
moment area principles they are easily determined. In Fig. b the slope of elastic curve at A
and B is zero or horizontal, thus the change in
slope between A and B is zero. By the 1st

algebraic sum of the moment areas between A and

To find the fixed end moments for a beam with

Solution:- Fig. b shows the static moment diagram
assuming the beam simply supported at A and B.
For simplicity in finding areas and taking moments
of the moment areas the moment diagram has been
diVided into the 4 simple shapes as shown. The
centroid of each portion is shown together with
the area which is shown as a concentrated load at
the centroids.
Fig. C shows the moment diagrams due to unknown moments MA and MB. The area of these triangles is shown as a concentrated load at the
centroids.
Since the change in slope of the elastic
curve between A and B is zero, the area of these
moment diagrams must equal zero, hence
5265 + 14040 + 2160 + 6885 + 15MA + 15MB = 0


or
15MA + 15MB + 28350 = 0 - - - - - - - - - - (1 )



In Fig. b the deflection of B away from a tangent to elastic curve at A is zero, and also deflection of A away from tangent to elastic curve
at B is zero.
Thus by moment area principle, the moment
of the moment diagrams of Fig. C about points A,
or B is zero.



flection of A away from tangent to elastic curve The deflection of point A away from tangent to
at B is zero. elastic curve at B is zero, therefore the first

**A7.l6** Truss Deflection by Method of Elastic
Weights

If the deflection of several or all the
joints of a trussed structure are required, the
method of elastic weights may save considerable
time over the method of virtual work used in
previous articles of this chapter. The method
in general consists of finding the magnitUde and
location of the elastic weight for each member
of a truss due to a strain from a given truss
loading or condition and applying these elastic
weights as concentrated loads on an imaginary
beam. The bending moment on this imaginary beam
due to this elastic loading equals numerically
the deflection of the given truss structure.
Consider the truss of diaGram (1) of Fig.
A7.49. Diagram (2) shows the deflection curve
for the truss for a ~L shortening of member bc,
all other members considered rigid. This deflection diagram can be determined by the virtual work ex pression 0 = u~L. Thus for deflection of joint 0, apply a uhit vertical load acting down at joint O. The stress m in bar he due
to this unit load = 2 2P 4P Therefore
:3 r 3r


The deflection at other
lower chord joints could
be found in a similar
manner by placing a unit load at these joints.
Diagram (2) shows the resulting deflection curve.
This diagram is plainly the influence line for
stress in bar bc multiplied by ~Lbc'
Diagram (3) shows an imaginary beam loaded
with an elastic load ~Lbc acting along a verti
r
cal line thru joint 0, the moment center for obtaining the stress in bar bc. The beam reactions for this elastic loading are also given.
Diagram (4) shows the beam bending moment diagram due to the elastic load at point O. It is
noticed that this moment diagram is identical to
the deflection diagram for the truss as shown in
diagram (2).
The elastic weight of a member is therefore
equal to the member deformation divided by the
arm r to its moment center. If this elastic
load is applied to an imaginary beam corresponding to the truss lower chord, the bending moment
on this imaginary beam will equal to the true
truss deflection.
Diagram 5, 6 and 7 of Fig. A7.49 gives a
similar study and the results for a ~L lengthening of member CK. The stress moment center for
this diagonal member lies at point 0', which lies
outside the truss. The elastic weight ~L at
q
point 0' can be replaced by an equivalent system
at points 0 and k on the imaginary beam as shown
in Diagram (6). These elastic loads produce a
bending moment diagram (Diagram 7) identical to
the deflection diagram of diagram (5).
Table A7.7 gives a summary of the equations
for the elastic weights of truss chord and web
members together with their location and sign.

Fig. A7.56 shows a simply supported truss
with cantilever overhang on each end. This simplified truss is representative of a cantilever

at e and en. The ~L deformation in each truss
member due to the given external loading is given on the figure. The complete truss elastic
loading will be determined. With the elastic
loading known the truss deflections from various
reference lines are readily determined.

lever over-hang portion of the truss relative to
support points e and e' .
Since the cantilever portion is not fixed at
e since the restraint is determined by the truss
between e' and e, this fact must be taken into
account in loading the cantilever portion. The
reactions on the beam of Fig. A7.58 represent
the slope at e due to the elastic loading between
e and e'. This elastic reaction in acting in the
reverse direction is therefore applied as a load
to the imaginary beam between e and a as shown in
Fig. A7.59.

In finding deflections this overhang elastically loaded portion is considered as fixed at
a and free at e. The bending moment at any point
on this beam equals the magnitude of the vertical
deflection at that point .
Thus to find the def~ection of the truss end
(JOint a) we find the bending moment at point a
of the imaginary beam of Fig. A7.59.
Hence
deflection at a = ZMa (calling counterclockwise positive). = (.01922 - .00312) 80 + .00248 x
70 + .00333 x 60 + .00239 x 50 + .00468 x 40 +
.00234 x 30 + .00543 x 20 - .00149 x 10 = 2.13"
upward. Due to symmetry of truss and loading of
the truss we know the slope of the elastic curve
at the center line of the truss is horizontal or
zero. Thus to find the deflection of any point
with reference to Joint f we can make use of the
deflection principle of the moment area method.
Thus in Fig. A7.60 the vertical deflection of any
point for example joint a, relative to Joint f
equals the moment of all elastic loaas between
a and f about a.
